warm water or medicated lotionsverb.- try to stir up public opinion (instigate or stir up (an undesirable or violent sentiment or course of action).) SENTENCE: Stand outside the school cafeteria passing out flyers with nutritional details on school food, and you may foment a revolution \u2014 foment means stirring up something undesirable, such as trouble. MNEMONIC: You would never say, \"Hooray, we fomented a revolution.\" Instead you'd say, \"Those good for nothing scalawags fomented the rebellion.\" Don't confuse foment and ferment. Ferment can mean \"to stir up\" in a good way \u2014 a football game can ferment excitement in a town, or foment trouble through traffic tie-ups and litter.", "MEANING: noun.- a substance from which another substance is formed (especially by a metabolic reaction)noun.- a person who goes before or announces the coming of anothernoun.- something that precedes and indicates the approach of something or someone SENTENCE: You've heard the old saying \"Pride comes before the fall?\" Well, you could just as easily say pride is a precursor to the fall. A precursor is something that happens before something else. MNEMONIC: You don't have to be a dead languages scholar to guess that this word springs from a Latin source \u2014 praecursor, \"to run before.\" A precursor is usually related to what it precedes. It's a catalyst or a harbinger, leading to what follows or providing a clue that it's going to happen. Binging on holiday candy is a precursor to tummy aches and promises to exercise more. Draconian policies in unstable nations are often a precursor to rebellion.", "MEANING: Noisy & DisorderSENTENCE: During The Lecture Of Probability, The Whole Class Became Tumultuous Because No Student Was Able To Comprehend The Difficult Concepts Of This Topic.MNEMONIC: It Is Derived From 'Tum Ult Ho' In Pakistan Which Means You Lack Discipline. So Tumultuous Must Mean Unrestrained And Disorderly.", "MEANING: Meticulous and Extremely Attentive To Details.SENTENCE: One Way To Get a Perfect Score on Gre Is To Scrupulously check your working of Each Question.MNEMONIC: Scrupulous = Scotland Yard Ki Pulous (Police); It'S Famous For Diligent Through Investigation With Careful Attention To Detail.", "MEANING: noun.- a rude expression intended to offend or hurt SENTENCE: Contumely is an old-fashioned term that means \"nasty, insulting speech,\" like the contumely heaped on the opposing team by a home team's fans. MNEMONIC: Don't be led astray by that -ly ending: contumely is a noun, not an adverb. Use contumely when you need an impressive (if obscure) way to say \"contemptuous language\" or \"offensive behavior.\" You might stop a bully in his tracks by shouting, \"I don't have to put up with this contumely!\" Experts believe this word comes from the Latin contumax, \"haughty or insolent.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- relatively long in duration; tediously protracted SENTENCE: Something protracted has been drawn out, usually in a tedious way. Protracted things are long and seem like they're never going to end. MNEMONIC: Anything protracted is lasting longer than you would like. A speech that seems to go on forever is protracted. If an employer and a union can't reach an agreement, there could be a protracted strike. Before a movie, the previews are almost always protracted \u2014 they never seem to stop. If something is long and annoying, and there's no good reason it couldn't be shorter, it's protracted.", "MEANING: adjective.- caused by or altered by or manifesting disease or pathologyadjective.- suggesting an unhealthy mental stateadjective.- suggesting the horror of death and decay SENTENCE: If the first section of the newspaper you read is the obituaries, you could be considered morbid. Morbid is a word used to describe anyone who spends too much time thinking about death or disease. MNEMONIC: A lot of English words relating to medicine and science come from Latin, and the adjective morbid is one of them; it comes from the root morbidus, meaning \"diseased\" or \"sick.\" Morbid can also be used to describe other nouns besides people. If you wear Goth clothing, your wardrobe might be described as morbid. And if you hang tombstones on your walls, your taste in art could also be described as morbid.", "MEANING: adjective.- affected by involuntary jerky muscular contractions; resembling a spasmadjective.- occurring in spells and often abruptly SENTENCE: Something that is spasmodic is experiencing a fit, a loss of muscular control. If you are spazzing out, you are spasmodic. MNEMONIC: A sudden fit or involuntary contraction of the muscles is called a spasm; thus spasmodic means to behave in such a way. Spasmodic is also commonly used to refer to a violent emotional outburst \u2014 for example, your parents might be spasmodic when they discover you're really majoring in partying, not medicine, at college.", "MEANING: adv.- Recurring In Scattered And Irregular Or Unpredictable Instancesadverb.- with spasmsadverb.- in spurts and fitsSENTENCE: If You Write Intermittently Or Spasmodically on the GRE Essay, You Will Probably Get Low Score Due To Less Use Of Words.MNEMONIC: Spasmodically = Spaces + Mods; So It'S Something That Is Not Consistent.", "MEANING: noun.- formal and explicit approvalverb.- consent to, give permissionnoun.- the human face (`kisser' and `smiler' and `mug' are informal terms for `face' and `phiz' is British)noun.- the appearance conveyed by a person's face SENTENCE: The noun countenance means the face or its expression. If you're a great poker player, you probably have a calm countenance. MNEMONIC: Countenance comes from a French word for \"behavior,\" but it has become a fancy term for either the expression of a face or the face itself: \"He had a puzzled countenance,\" or \"what a charming countenance!\" Countenance can also be a verb meaning to tolerate or approve. If someone does something offensive, tell them, \"I'm afraid I can't countenance that.\"", "MEANING: verb.- show disapproval by discouraging (Refuse To Approve)verb.- look with disfavor onSENTENCE: When capitalist development discountenances the people, it loses its soul. The soul of capitalist development at the national, regional and global level must be the people. MNEMONIC: Discountenance = Dis (Not) + Countenance (Count For); So It'S Something Not Count For Or Refuse To Consider.", "MEANING: adjective.- (of plants) growing in groups that are close togetheradjective.- (of animals) tending to form a group with others of the same speciesadjective.- instinctively or temperamentally seeking and enjoying the company of others SENTENCE: If you know someone who's outgoing, sociable, and fond of the company of others, you might want to call her gregarious. MNEMONIC: The word was originally used to describe animals that live in flocks \u2014 it's from the Latin word grex, meaning \"herd.\" Not surprisingly, people began using it to describe humans who liked being in groups. Today biologists still speak of gregarious species, but you're more likely to hear it in reference to people. Despite what you might suspect, it has no historical connection to the name Gregory \u2014 but if you know an outgoing fellow with that name, you could call him Greg-arious.", "MEANING: adjective.- conspicuously and outrageously bad or reprehensible SENTENCE: Something that is egregious stands out, but not in a good way \u2014 it means \"really bad or offensive.\" If you make an egregious error during a championship soccer match, your coach might bench you for the rest of the game. MNEMONIC: \"My massage therapist gave me bruises,\" someone complained recently on Twitter, asking, \"When does it cease to be deep tissue massage therapy and become egregious and unabashed manhandling?\" An egregious error is hardly forgivable. Some synonyms are shocking, appalling, and intolerable. The word has made a 180-degree turn from its original sense in Latin, when it meant \"exceptionally good.\" Word historians have speculated that the negative usage was originally meant to be ironic, but it is the only sense that has survived. Be careful not to use it to mean \"outstanding,\" since no one wants to be called egregious.", "MEANING: noun.- propriety in manners and conduct SENTENCE: Decorum is proper and polite behavior. If you let out a big belch at a fancy dinner party, you're not showing much decorum. MNEMONIC: This noun is from Latin dec\u014drus \"proper, becoming, handsome,\" from d\u00e9cor \"beauty, grace,\" which is also the source of English d\u00e9cor. The corresponding adjective is decorous, meaning \"well-behaved in a particular situation.\" Both decorum and decorous are often used to describe behavior in a classroom or courtroom.", "MEANING: adjective.- angered at something unjust or wrong SENTENCE: To be incensed is to be beyond mad. It's how you feel when fighting with your cell phone company's customer service representative whose only response is to quote company policy verbatim from a script. MNEMONIC: The Latin root of the word incense is incendere, meaning \"to set on fire.\" Yes, it's the same root for the incense sticks burned in dorm rooms and churches. For this use, however, think instead about burning tempers instead of burning sticks.", "MEANING: verb.- treat condescendinglyverb.- do one's shopping at; do business with; be a customer or client ofverb.- be a regular customer or client ofverb.- assume sponsorship of SENTENCE: If you patronize a business, you shop there regularly. But if someone patronizes you, it's not so pleasant \u2014 they talk to you as if you were inferior or not very intelligent. MNEMONIC: Patronize comes from Latin patronus \"protector, master,\" related to pater \"father.\" So if you patronize a person, you talk down to them like a father might do to his child or a master to his apprentice. If you want to take an advanced class and your advisor warns you of all the hard work, you can tell him to stop patronizing you \u2014 you know a hard class involves hard work. This sounds much better than saying, \"I'm not stupid!\"", "MEANING: adjective.- (used of behavior or attitude) characteristic of those who treat others with condescension SENTENCE: If you are patronizing, you tend to speak down to others, acting as though you are smarter, classier, or just plain better than anyone else. For the record, your snobby attitude is not impressing anyone. MNEMONIC: A \"patron\" is someone who subsidizes or finances another person or organization \u2014 usually an artist or charitable institution. So the word patronizing stems from this idea of someone bestowing money or help on another.  Today, the sense of condescension is strongly attached to the adjective, while the word \"patron\" is still a positive description of someone who gives.", "MEANING: verb.- claim as due or justverb.- take as an undesirable consequence of some event or state of affairsadjective.- (of ideas, images, representations, expressions) characterized by perfect conformity to fact or truth ; strictly correctadjective.- marked by strict and particular and complete accordance with fact SENTENCE: If something's exact, it's precise and completely accurate \u2014 as opposed to a guess, an estimate, or an approximation. MNEMONIC: Exact also has the meaning of taking something from someone, often money, and generally only given up with reluctance under the threat of force. The Mob might exact a shakedown from unfortunate businessmen, for example. The word comes from the Latin exactus \"exact or accurate,\" a form of the verb exigere \u2014 meaning \"to force out or demand,\" like the Mob demanding its money.", "MEANING: adjective.- having complicated nutritional requirements; especially growing only in special artificial culturesadjective.- requiring precise accuracyadjective.- severe and unremitting in making demands SENTENCE: Use the adjective exacting to describe something or someone very precise or strict in its requirements. If your teacher has exacting standards about spelling and punctuation, you better carefully check your final paper. MNEMONIC: An exacting person expects things to be, well, exact. For this reason, demanding is a good synonym. Friends who are exacting might let you have it if you show up a minute or two late. Some exacting people are extremely selective about what they eat, rejecting anything that doesn't meet their complicated standards of nutrition and taste.", "MEANING: noun.- model of excellence or perfection of a kind; one having no equalnoun.- an ideal instance; a perfect embodiment of a concept SENTENCE: Paragon applies to someone who is a model of perfection in some quality or trait. We link paragon with other words that follow it, such as \"paragon of virtue\" or \"paragon of patience.\" MNEMONIC: A paragon means someone or something that is the very best. The English noun paragon comes from the Italian word paragone, which is a touchstone, a black stone that is used to tell the quality of gold. You rub the gold on the touchstone and you can find out how good the gold is. You are hoping that it is the paragon of \"goldness.\"", "MEANING: noun.- complete and confirmed integrity; having strong moral principles SENTENCE: Though probity sounds like what you might do with a sharp stick, it actually means being morally and ethically above reproach, or having integrity. MNEMONIC: If you show fiscal probity, it means you are responsible and ethical with your money. The story of George Washington chopping down the cherry tree and refusing to lie about it is a story of probity. The story was first told by a pastor, who may have made the whole thing up according to today's scholars, possibly to sell books \u2014 no act of probity.", "MEANING: adjective.- highly complex or intricate and occasionally deviousadjective.- entangled or hindered as if e.g. in mireadjective.- envelopedadjective.- emotionally involvedadjective.- connected by participation or association or use SENTENCE: Being involved means being a part of something or associated with it. If you volunteer on a team to clean up the playground, you're involved in making it a safer and more fun place for kids to play. MNEMONIC: Involved is an adjective with many different uses. It can describe something difficult or complicated, as in \"really involved instructions for putting together a plane model,\" or it describes relationships and partnerships, like when you\u2019re involved with someone in a serious dating relationship or are involved in helping out as a tutor after school. You can be involved in more negative situations, too, as when a country is involved in spying on another or a group is involved in plotting a crime.", "MEANING: adjective.- careful and sensible; marked by sound judgment SENTENCE: Describe an action as prudent if it is the wise thing to do under the existing circumstances. If you're getting in trouble, it is probably prudent to keep your mouth closed and just listen. MNEMONIC: If you show good and careful judgment when handling practical matters, you can be described as prudent. Similarly, a wise and well-thought-through decision or action can be called prudent. The word comes from a contracted form of the Latin pr\u014dvid\u0113ns from the verb \"to foresee.\" The English word provident \"wise in planning for the future\" is the non-contracted descendent of the same Latin root.", "MEANING: noun.- disgrace or shamenoun.- a mild rebuke or criticismverb.- express criticism towards SENTENCE: Reproach means to mildly criticize. If you show poor manners at your grandmother's dinner table, she will reproach you. MNEMONIC: The verb reproach means to express disapproval or criticism of; as a noun it means blame or criticism. If you are beyond reproach that means no one could find anything to criticize about you. Synonyms for reproach are the verbs admonish, reprove, rebuke, reprimand. As a noun, reproach can also be shame. If you are caught lying, it is a reproach that might bother you for a while.", "MEANING: adjective.- marked by or showing hopelessness SENTENCE: Sniff, sniff, boo-hoo... use the adjective forlorn to express loneliness and feeling left out. MNEMONIC: When someone is forlorn it means that they not only feel miserable but simultaneously desolate because they also believe they are alone. Forlorn is a very old word in English, and in fact it comes from the Old English word forlesen and means \"to lose completely.\" Synonyms for forlorn all have fairly sad meanings: disconsolate, pessimistic, despairing, despondent, abandoned, depressed, desperate.", "MEANING: noun.- a plant that is found in an area where it had not been recorded previouslynoun.- a new convert being taught the principles of Christianity by a catechistnoun.- any new participant in some activity SENTENCE: A neophyte is someone who's brand new at something. You're a neophyte the first time you pick up a guitar and start learning to play. MNEMONIC: Neo- means new, and -phyte is from the Greek phuton, \"plant\" \u2014 like a baby plant, a neophyte is someone who is new to an activity. In Greek, neophytos (literally \"newly planted\") was used to refer to a new church convert. A political neophyte is someone who is newly elected and comes to Washington D.C. not understanding how the game of politics is played. A Frisbee neophyte is someone who has just thrown the disc for the first time.", "MEANING: adjective.- intentionally untrueadjective.- given to lying SENTENCE: A mendacious person is one who tells lies habitually and intentionally. Don't get stuck at the water cooler or bus stop next to someone you consider mendacious! MNEMONIC: People may tell \"white lies\" if they forgot your birthday or really don't like your new haircut, but if you catch someone intentionally manipulating you with a falsehood, that person is just plain mendacious. So think of the most deceptive, insincere, perfidious, duplicitous, false person you've ever met, and then add the word mendacious to that list.", "MEANING: adjective.- timid by nature or revealing timidity SENTENCE: A timorous person is timid or shy, like your timorous friend who likes to hang out with close pals but gets nervous around big groups of new people. MNEMONIC: The adjective timorous is actually the Latin word for \u201dfearful.\u201d But timorous is a specific kind of fearfulness \u2014 the kind that strikes people before giving a speech, or walking into a crowded place where people are socializing. Also called \"shy\" or \"timid,\" timorous people often become more comfortable when they see a familiar face in the crowd.", "MEANING: verb.- introduce or insert (oneself) in a subtle mannerverb.- give to understand SENTENCE: Insinuate means you imply or suggest something that may or may not be true. If you say things seemed to go wrong about the time your brother took over, you insinuate that he had something to do with the decline. MNEMONIC: There's another way to insinuate. Suppose you're in line to get into a popular dance club when a celebrity appears, surrounded by a big entourage. If you strike up a conversation with one of the entourage, you may be able to insinuate that you're part of the group and go in with them. Don't feel bad \u2014 people have been doing it at least since the 1520s, when insinuate evolved from the Latin word insinuare, meaning \"wind one's way into.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- narrowly restricted in outlook or scopeadjective.- suggestive of the isolated life of an islandadjective.- relating to or characteristic of or situated on an island SENTENCE: Insular means \"having a narrow view of the world,\" like insular people who never leave their small town, which enables them to believe that every place in the world is the same and the people are all just like them. MNEMONIC: The adjective insular comes from the Latin word insula, which means \u201cisland.\u201d Perhaps less so in our current age of technological and relatively easy travel, island life can still be separated from the rest. That's why insular can mean \"isolated from,\" like if you grew up in a big city then visited a rural place, you may be surprised that stores close early. Such an experience will help you expand your insular views.", "MEANING: noun.- the state of being isolated or detached SENTENCE: The noun insularity refers to the quality of being isolated or detached. In fact, the word is based on the Latin word insula, for \"island.\" The phrase \"no man is an island\" means that no one can be completely separate from others. MNEMONIC: The word insularity has a sense of detachment and insulation, but sometimes the meaning is extended to mean being narrow-minded. Parents always try to protect their kids from harm, but sometimes their insularity goes too far. If you grew up in the 1950s, for example, your parents may have wanted to protect you from the evils of Elvis and rock and roll.", "MEANING: noun.- abusive or venomous language used to express blame or censure or bitter deep-seated ill will SENTENCE: Invective is harsh, abusive language, like \"you dirty rotten scoundrel.\"  I'm sure you can think of harsher and more obscene examples, but we won't get into them here. MNEMONIC: Invective comes from the Latin for \"abusive.\"  It kind of sounds like a harsh word, actually, with those sharp, dagger-like V's.  People usually put a colorful verb or phrase before it. Some examples: \"She spewed invective,\" \"She hurled invective,\" \"She burst forth into invective.\"  You can follow it with a phrase like, \"picking up her plate and throwing it across the room.\"", "MEANING: verb.- prove to be false or incorrectverb.- overthrow by argument, evidence, or proof SENTENCE: The verb refute is to prove that something is wrong. When the kids you're babysitting swear they brushed their teeth, you can refute their claim by presenting the dry toothbrushes. MNEMONIC: Evidence and arguments are used to refute something. So are facts. For example, if children who eat chocolate before going to bed go straight to sleep, that refutes the idea that sugar keeps them up. Refute comes from the Latin refutare for \"to check, suppress.\" A near synonym is confute, but save refute as an everyday word for proving something is false.", "MEANING: verb.- block passage throughverb.- be a hindrance or obstacle to SENTENCE: To impede something is to delay or block its progress or movement. Carrying six heavy bags will impede your progress if you're trying to walk across town in a hurry. MNEMONIC: Impede comes from the Latin impedire which literally means \"to hold the feet,\" formed from the prefix in-, (\"in\") plus pes (\"foot\"). Think about walking with a cast on your foot \u2014 how slow and awkward that would be. If you struggle with reading, that might impede your progress in your social studies class. An impediment is something that impedes, such as a physical defect that affects speech \u2014 a speech impediment.", "MEANING: verb.- increase the value ofverb.- gain in valueverb.- make aware ofverb.- inform (somebody) of something SENTENCE: To apprise someone about something is to fill them in, to give them the scoop. If someone in your immediate family wins the mega-bucks lottery, you want to be the first one to be apprised of that event! MNEMONIC: Don't confuse the verbs apprise and appraise. Appraise means to determine the value of something \u2014 either its quality or its monetary worth. Apprise, on the other hand, means to inform or make aware. This word has a rather formal, weighty tone. Presidents get apprised of foreign affairs, but you will most likely not get apprised of weather conditions or dinner plans.", "MEANING: adjective.- not having a common center; not concentricnoun.- a person of a specified kind (usually with many eccentricities)noun.- a person with an unusual or odd personalityadjective.- conspicuously or grossly unconventional or unusual SENTENCE: You're most likely to encounter the adjective eccentric in a description of an unusual or quirky person \u2014 like a scatterbrained aunt who leaves her life savings to her cat. MNEMONIC: From the Greek ekkentros, \"out of the center,\" this word originally had to do with the orbits of planets that were observed to be slightly out of whack. Eventually it came to describe people who were a little kooky, both as an adjective and as a noun, too: an eccentric is an unconventional, odd person. Think of them as following a slightly different orbit from the rest of society.", "MEANING: adjective.- conspicuously and offensively loud; given to vehement outcry SENTENCE: Vociferous describes loudmouths, such as the vociferous mob at the soccer game. MNEMONIC: Vociferous is from the Latin vociferari, meaning \"to shout, yell.\" If you break it down to the first part, take vox, meaning \"voice\" and add it to ferre, meaning \"to carry,\" then vociferous describes voices that carry; you can hear a vociferous person from across the room at a dance party. Vociferous isn't just loud, but annoying, too, like when the vociferous fans of the opposing team chant insults in unison. Try yanking a cookie out of a little kid's hand if you want to hear a vociferous reaction.", "MEANING: verb.- restrict or confineverb.- draw a line aroundverb.- draw a geometric figure around another figure so that the two are in contact but do not intersect SENTENCE: To circumscribe is to limit or restrict. If you spend too much time watching TV instead of fulfilling other obligations, you might circumscribe your TV-watching time to one hour daily (or two hours, if your favorite show is on). MNEMONIC: Circumscribe comes from the Latin words circum, meaning \"around,\" and scribere, meaning \"to write.\" If the word circumscribe causes you to think of geometry class, give yourself a pat on the back. In geometry, circumscribe means to draw one geometric figure around another figure so that the two figures touch but don\u2019t intersect. If you studied geometry but this sounds unfamiliar, perhaps you should have taken our advice about watching too much TV.", "MEANING: adjective.- not straightforward or candid; giving a false appearance of frankness SENTENCE: Use the adjective disingenuous to describe behavior that's not totally honest or sincere. It's disingenuous when people pretend to know less about something than they really do. MNEMONIC: Disingenuous combines dis-, meaning \"not,\" with ingenuous (from the Latin gen-, meaning \"born\") which was originally used to distinguish free-born Romans from slaves, and later came to mean honest or straightforward. So disingenuous means dishonest. Ingenuous is less common now than disingenuous, but we still use it for someone who is sincere to the point of naivet\u00e9.  A good synonym is insincere.", "MEANING: noun.- a person who tries to please someone in order to gain a personal advantage SENTENCE: A sycophant is a person who tries to win favor from wealthy or influential people by flattering them. Also known as brown-nosers, teacher's pets or suck-ups. MNEMONIC: Sycophant is from Latin sycophanta, from Greek sykophant\u0113s, from sykon \"fig\" and phainein \"to show, make known.\" The original sense was that of an informer, a person who gives information about criminal activities. \"Showing the fig\" was a vulgar gesture made by sticking the thumb between two fingers. The gesture was used to taunt an opponent or to make an accusation against someone.", "MEANING: verb.- amount in the aggregate toverb.- gather in a mass, sum, or wholeadjective.- composed of a dense cluster of separate units such as carpels or florets or drupeletsadjective.- formed of separate units gathered into a mass or wholenoun.- material such as sand or gravel used with cement and water to make concrete, mortar, or plasternoun.- the whole amountnoun.- a sum total of many heterogenous things taken together SENTENCE: To aggregate is to collect many units into one. If you're writing a novel, you might create a character who is an aggregate of five or six real people. MNEMONIC: Aggregate comes from the Latin verb aggregare, which means to add to. As a verb it means to collect into a mass or whole. You can also use it as an adjective, as in your aggregate sales for February, March and April. It can also be a noun. The mountain of foam in bubble bath is an aggregate of small bubbles. If you plan to work in economics or business, expect to see the word aggregate quite a lot.", "MEANING: adjective.- pleasing to the ear SENTENCE: Use the adjective mellifluous to describe something that sounds sweet and smooth, like the honeyed voice of a late-night radio DJ. MNEMONIC: You might think that that mell in mellifluous has something to do with mellow. Actually, it's related to Melissa.  In Greek mythology, Melissa was a nymph who discovered that you could eat the smooth, sweet stuff that bees make. Honeybees were named after her, and their tasty product was called meli. Mellifluous means to \"flow as if with honey.\"", "MEANING: noun.- a color or pigment varying around a light grey-brown colorverb.- show submission or fearverb.- try to gain favor by cringing or flatteringverb.- have fawnsnoun.- a young deer SENTENCE: A fawn is a young deer, but it's also a verb meaning to try and win favor by flattering. You might fawn over Bambi if you want to hang out with the cute and fuzzy gang. MNEMONIC: As a verb, fawn either refers to an attempt to get on someone\u2019s good side, or, oddly enough, to give birth to a deer. If you're a human, fawning is an age-old art that might get you what you want but can be very unattractive. If you ever come into possession of a great fortune, watch out for sudden friends who want to fawn over you and shower you with presents. They probably have dollar signs in their eyes.", "MEANING: adjective.- attempting to win favor from influential people by flatteryadjective.- attempting to win favor by flattery SENTENCE: Use fawning to describe someone who's over the top in the flattery department. Like a fawning admirer who just won't stop complimenting your looks, showering you with gifts and otherwise kissing the ground you walk on. MNEMONIC: From the Old English f\u00e6gnian, meaning \u201crejoice, exult, be glad,\u201d fawning can be both an adjective and a noun form of the verb fawn. Fawning people are often trying to win favor with the person being flattered, and it sometimes comes off as sucking up. So do everyone a favor and don't try to boost your poor grades by fawning over your professor\u2019s every word.", "MEANING: adjective.- marked by a narrow focus on or display of learning especially its trivial aspects SENTENCE: There's nothing wrong with focusing on the details, but someone who is pedantic makes a big display of knowing obscure facts and details. MNEMONIC: Pedantic means \"like a pedant,\" someone who's too concerned with literal accuracy or formality.  It's a negative term that implies someone is showing off book learning or trivia, especially in a tiresome way. You don't want to go antique-shopping with a pedantic friend, who will use the opportunity to bore you with his in-depth knowledge of 18th-century porcelain kitty-litter boxes.", "MEANING: adjective.- excessively forward SENTENCE: When someone takes liberties, doing things too boldly, you can describe them with the adjective presumptuous. MNEMONIC: Presumptuous comes from the Latin verb praesumere which means to take for granted. It means taking for granted your access to someone or power to do something. It's a very satisfying and effective word because it belittles and criticizes at the same time. In Shakespeare's Henry VI, Northumberland calls Warwick \"presumptuous and proud\" for trying to get rid of the king.  It's usually pronounced with all four syllables, pre-ZUMP-choo-us, although pre-ZUMP-chus is acceptable as well.", "MEANING: noun.- a song or hymn of mourning composed or performed as a memorial to a dead person SENTENCE: A dirge is a song of mourning, performed as a memorial to someone who\u2019s died. As you might imagine, a dirge is usually quite sad. Another word with a similar meaning that you might know is \u201crequiem.\u201d MNEMONIC: The noun dirge comes from the Latin dirige, which means \u201cdirect,\u201d and is the beginning of a prayer that translates as \u201cDirect my way in your sight, O Lord my God.\u201d Dirge can still have a religious meaning, but it can also be any sad and mournful song, poem, or hymn composed or performed in memory of someone who has died. You can also say that something mournful sounds like a dirge, using the word in a more poetic sense.", "MEANING: adjective.- recurring in scattered and irregular or unpredictable instances SENTENCE: Sporadic is an adjective that you can use to refer to something that happens or appears often, but not constantly or regularly. The mail carrier comes every day but the plumber's visits are sporadic\u2013\u2013he comes as needed. MNEMONIC: A specialized use of sporadic is to describe a disease that appears only occasionally in random cases, and is therefore not an epidemic.  English borrowed the word sporadic from Greek sporadik\u00f3s \"scattered.\" A very near synonym is intermittent.", "MEANING: adjective.- showing a brooding ill humoradjective.- bitter or scornful SENTENCE: Medieval alchemists ascribed to the planet Saturn a gloomy and slow character. When people are called saturnine, it means they are like the planet \u2014 gloomy, mean, scowling. Not exactly the life of the party. MNEMONIC: Saturnine is a word you don't hear often nowadays, though you probably know people with saturnine dispositions. The ultimate saturnine character in literature is Heathcliff \u2014 and for clarification's sake, that would be the brooding, bitter, brooding, obsessive hero of Wuthering Heights, not the lovably pudgy cat of comic-strip fame.", "MEANING: verb.- decline to initiate bettingnoun.- obstructing an opponent in ice hockeyverb.- block or impede (a player from the opposing team) in ice hockeyverb.- place into checknoun.- (chess) a direct attack on an opponent's kingnoun.- a mark left after a small piece has been chopped or broken off of somethingverb.- become fractured; break or crack on the surface onlyverb.- make cracks or chinks inverb.- mark into squares or draw squares on; draw crossed lines onnoun.- a textile pattern of squares or crossed lines (resembling a checkerboard)verb.- put a check mark on or near or next tonoun.- a mark indicating that something has been noted or completed etc.verb.- write out a check on a bank accountnoun.- the bill in a restaurantnoun.- a written order directing a bank to pay moneynoun.- the state of inactivity following an interruptionnoun.- something immaterial that interferes with or delays action or progressnoun.- the act of restraining power or action or limiting excessverb.- abandon the intended prey, turn, and pursue an inferior preyverb.- stop in a chase especially when scent is lostverb.- stop for a moment, as if out of uncertainty or cautionverb.- arrest the motion (of something) abruptlyverb.- hold back, as of a danger or an enemy; check the expansion or influence ofverb.- slow the growth or development ofverb.- lessen the intensity of; temper; hold in restraint; hold or keep within limitsnoun.- additional proof that something that was believed (some fact or hypothesis or theory) is correctnoun.- the act of inspecting or verifyingnoun.- an appraisal of the state of affairsverb.- develop (children's) behavior by instruction and practice; especially to teach self-controlverb.- consign for shipment on a vehicleverb.- hand over something to somebody as for temporary safekeepingverb.- be compatible, similar or consistent; coincide in their characteristicsverb.- be verified or confirmed; pass inspectionverb.- find out, learn, or determine with certainty, usually by making an inquiry or other effortverb.- verify by consulting a source or authorityverb.- be careful or certain to do something; make certain of somethingverb.- make an examination or investigationverb.- examine so as to determine accuracy, quality, or condition SENTENCE: Check: Small word, loads of different meanings. One of the most common is \"to inspect or verify.\" You might check the oven to see if your cookies are done. MNEMONIC: A few of the many meanings of check: As a noun: the act of restraining power or action; a pattern of squares resembling a checkerboard; a restaurant bill; a financial instrument payable to the named bearer (from your checkbook); a mark indicating that something's been noted or finished. As a verb: to crack on the surface; to slow or delay growth; to obstruct your hockey opponent; to hand over for inventory and safekeeping, especially baggage on a plane.", "MEANING: adjective.- having only a limited ability to react chemically; chemically inactiveadjective.- fairly poor to not very goodadjective.- (usually followed by `to') unwilling or refusing to pay heedadjective.- neither too great nor too littleadjective.- being neither good nor badadjective.- characterized by a lack of partialityadjective.- marked by no especial liking or dislike or preference for one thing over anotheradjective.- (often followed by `to') lacking importance; not mattering one way or the otheradjective.- showing no care or concern in attitude or actionadjective.- marked by a lack of interest SENTENCE: If you're indifferent about something, you don't care much about it one way or another. You might feel indifferent about politics, changing the channel whenever the TV news comes on. MNEMONIC: People seem indifferent when they're obviously unconcerned \u2014 an indifferent observer of a tennis match is clearly not rooting for either player, and an indifferent voter might choose a candidate at the last minute by flipping a coin. A slightly less common meaning of indifferent is \"unbiased or impartial,\" which you can see in its root, the Old French indifferent, or \"impartial.\" In this sense of the word, we all hope our laws and legal system are indifferent.", "MEANING: noun.- capacity or power to produce a desired effect SENTENCE: The degree to which a method or medicine brings about a specific result is its efficacy. You might not like to eat it, but you can't question the efficacy of broccoli as a health benefit. MNEMONIC: Efficacy is a more formal way to say effectiveness, both of which stem from the Latin verb efficere \"to work out, accomplish.\" The effectiveness, or efficacy, of something is how well it works or brings the results you hoped for. A scientist does research to determine the efficacy of a vaccine or medicine under development. If it is efficacious, it will cure or prevent a disease.", "MEANING: adjective.- defiantly aggressive SENTENCE: If you are quick to argue, always looking for a fight, and hard to please, you are truculent. You can also write a truculent essay, and fans upset by a loss can become truculent. MNEMONIC: This word has no connection to truck, but the similar sound is still a good way to remember it: truculent folks are like monster trucks, ready to run over anything that gets in their way. To be truculent is to be defiant, aggressive, and quarrelsome. A truculent student will get in trouble with teachers, and a truculent teacher might get fired. In a violent sport like football, it helps to be truculent, but it's usually not a great quality.", "MEANING: noun.- obstreperous and defiant aggressiveness SENTENCE: If you get into fights all of the time, you might be accused of truculence and sent for anger management classes. Truculence is showing a fierce kind of aggression. MNEMONIC: If your basketball team wins a game by sheer truculence, it means that they win not by skill or talent, but by playing with ferocious aggression. It would be a dirty win, one with lots of fouls and thrown elbows. Truculence comes from the Latin word for trux meaning fierce or wild.", "MEANING: adjective.- showing hovering attentivenessadjective.- full of anxiety and concern SENTENCE: When you hear the word solicitous, think of your mom \u2014 attentive, caring, and concerned. It's nice when your waiter gives you good service, but if he or she is solicitous, the hovering might annoy you. MNEMONIC: Solicitous comes from the Latin roots sollus \"entire\" and citus \"set in motion.\" If someone is solicitous, they are entirely set in motion caring for you. Your neighbors are solicitous if they try to help your family out all the time. Use this word too if you're eager to do something. A good student will be solicitous to appear interested in what the teacher says \u2014 even when it's not that interesting.", "MEANING: noun.- temporary cessation or suspension SENTENCE: An abeyance is a temporary halt to something, with the emphasis on \"temporary.\" It is usually used with the word \"in\" or \"into\"; \"in abeyance\" suggests a state of waiting or holding. MNEMONIC: The word abeyance has a legal ring to it, and for a good reason \u2014 appearing in English in the 16th century, it comes from the Anglo-French word abeiance, a legal term for waiting or hoping to receive property. Nowadays, the word is used in a similar way. Different legal rights, like property rights, can be held in abeyance until matters are resolved.", "MEANING: adjective.- using or containing too many words SENTENCE: If you're verbose, you use far more words than you need to. A verbose book report goes on and on and is packed with long, complicated words that aren't at all necessary. MNEMONIC: If a friend asks, \"Did you have fun at the party?\" you can simply answer, \"No.\" Or you can provide a verbose reply that describes just how much you hated the party, who was and wasn't there, the fact that you got lost on the way, the terrible food that was served, and the awful music that was played. Verbose is from Latin verbosus \"full of words,\" from verbum, \"word or verb.\" As you can guess from the spelling, the English verb is closely related.", "MEANING: adjective.- not essentialadjective.- not pertinent to the matter under considerationadjective.- coming from the outsideadjective.- not belonging to that in which it is contained; introduced from an outside source SENTENCE: Extraneous means coming from the outside, like the extraneous noise you hear when you're in a theater and a train passes by. Extraneous can also mean not relevant or essential, like all the extraneous information in your long-winded science report. MNEMONIC: In Latin, extra means outside, as in extraordinary \"outside the ordinary,\" or extraterrestrial 'coming from outside earth.' (Bonus points\u2013\u2013ding! ding!\u2013\u2013if you knew that terra is Latin for \"earth.\") The meaning of extraneous also extends to more abstract things that come from the outside: extraneous details are ones that don't matter.", "MEANING: adjective.- repeated too often; overfamiliar through overuse SENTENCE: Hackneyed is a word for language that doesn't pack a punch since it's overused and trite. \"Roses are red, violets are...\" \u2014 enough already?! That's hackneyed stuff. MNEMONIC: Hackneyed is usually used to describe tired writing, but you can also refer to the hackneyed plots of television sit-coms or the hackneyed jokes of your Uncle Fred. But, most often, you will see hackneyed before the word phrase to refer to a specific clich\u00e9 that is annoying the heck out of someone.", "MEANING: verb.- treat or speak of with contempt SENTENCE: The verb deride means to speak to someone with contempt or show a low opinion of someone or something. A bully might constantly deride other kids in his class \u2014 which might lead to many afternoons spent in the principal's office. MNEMONIC: To \"ride\" people is to get on their case or give them a hard time, and to deride is to do the same with insulting language or poor treatment. Deride comes from the Latin root d\u0113r\u012bd\u0113re, meaning \"to ridicule, to scorn,\" and it's often used to express dislike or even hatred. Criticizing something with words is a common way to deride, and politicians often deride each other in their speeches during election campaigns.", "MEANING: noun.- the quality of wearisome constancy, routine, and lack of varietyadjective.- not challenging; dull and lacking excitementadjective.- tediously repetitious or lacking in variety SENTENCE: That class on 18th century feminist zoologists and their favorite poets? Surprisingly humdrum, or dull, tedious, and totally boring. MNEMONIC: Anything that you can call humdrum is so severely lacking in variety and excitement that it's sure to make you hum and drum your fingers out of boredom. Humdrum is an adjective to describe the unglamorous monotony of everyday routines. It's the same old thing, again and again, over and over. Humdrum can also mean predictable, mind-numbing and not very challenging \u2014 hopefully the complete opposite of your social life.", "MEANING: noun.- the state of being known for some unfavorable act or quality SENTENCE: Notoriety is fame you get from doing something bad or being part of a misfortune or scandal. Just remember: Notoriety's not al-righty. Charles Manson earned notoriety for his grisly crimes. MNEMONIC: In our celebrity culture, it's hard not to think that seizing your 15 minutes of fame is worth the shame of earning it through stupidity, scandal, or evil. (See: people's motives for going on reality television.) We ordinary mortals can comfort ourselves with the knowledge that most people who become notorious fade from the public mind quickly.", "MEANING: adjective.- exhibiting courtesy and politenessadjective.- characterized by courtesy and gracious good manners SENTENCE: If you are courteous, your good manners show friendliness and concern for others, like your courteous habit of holding the door for people entering a building with you. MNEMONIC: The adjective courteous comes from the Old French word curteis, which means \u201chaving courtly bearing or manners.\u201d Courtly described the court \u2014 nobles who hung around the castle, the entourage of kings and queens. Their refined manners, not to mention their wealth and power, set them apart from the masses. So courteous behavior is a reminder of the value of good manners.", "MEANING: adjective.- of or relating to or acting along or in the direction of a tangentadjective.- of superficial relevance if any SENTENCE: Tangential describes something that's not part of the whole. If you make a comment that is tangential to the story you're telling, it's a digression. The story could still be understood without it. MNEMONIC: In geometry, a tangent is a line that touches a curve in one spot but doesn't intersect it anywhere else. Tangential means something that goes off in one direction that way and doesn't return. People can feel tangential \u2014 as though they're inessential and not relevant to a larger group.", "MEANING: adjective.- ostentatiously lofty in style SENTENCE: To be bombastic is to be full of hot air \u2014 like a politician who makes grand promises and doesn't deliver. MNEMONIC: What does cotton padding have to do with the word bombastic? Bombast was cotton padding or stuffing in the 1500s. Bombastic evolved as an adjective to describe something (or someone!) that is overly wordy, pompous, or pretentious, but the adjective is most often used to describe language (speech or writing). Still not seeing the connection to cotton padding? Think of writing or speech that is overly padded and you'll understand how the meaning came about.", "MEANING: adjective.- implied by or inferred from actions or statements SENTENCE: Something tacit is implied or understood without question. Holding hands might be a tacit acknowledgment that a boy and girl are dating. MNEMONIC: The adjective tacit refers to information that is understood without needing to acknowledge it. For example, since we know that the sky is blue, that kind of assumption is tacit. Lawyers talk about \"tacit agreements,\" where parties give their silent consent and raise no objections.", "MEANING: noun.- the act of temperingnoun.- abstaining from excessnoun.- the trait of avoiding excesses SENTENCE: Temperance means restraint and moderation, but if you're talking about alcohol, temperance means not just drinking in moderation, it means not having it at all. MNEMONIC: The temperance movement appeared in the U.S. in the 19th century, at first urging moderation in drinking but eventually seeking to outlaw alcohol entirely. It managed to get Prohibition enacted in 1919, which did outlaw alcohol, but it was repealed in 1933. Temperance doesn't just have to do with alcohol, it can refer to avoiding any kind of excess: if your new diet requires temperance, you're eating in a balanced, sensible way. Temperance comes from the Latin temperare, \"restrain.\"", "MEANING: noun.- a feeling of anger caused by being offended SENTENCE: When someone takes umbrage at something, they find it offensive, and it probably makes them angry. MNEMONIC: Umbrage comes from the same source as umbrella, the Latin umbra, \"shade, shadow.\" The umbrella was invented to keep you in shade, and when you take umbrage at something, you're casting a shadow over the person or thing responsible for the offense. I take umbrage at the suggestion that I'm not a nice person: it's offensive and infuriating. After having devoted my life to helping animals, I might take umbrage at the notion that I've been doing it for publicity purposes: I resent the idea that it was for any other reason than my love of animals.", "MEANING: adjective.- rolled longitudinally upon itselfadjective.- highly complex or intricate and occasionally devious SENTENCE: If something is convoluted, it's intricate and hard to understand. You'll need to read over your brother's convoluted investment scheme a few times before deciding whether or not to go in on it. MNEMONIC: Convoluted comes from the Latin convolutus for rolled up together. Its original meaning in English was exactly that, first for eaves coiled up on themselves, then for anything rolled or knotted together. Over time convoluted took on its metaphorical sense of complicated and intricate, which is how it's generally used today. People complain about convoluted legal language and the convoluted tax code.", "MEANING: noun.- a pillow that is often put across a bed underneath the regular pillowsverb.- add padding toverb.- prop up with a pillow or bolsterverb.- support and strengthen SENTENCE: When you cheer up a friend who's feeling down, you bolster them. To bolster is to offer support or strengthen. MNEMONIC: A bolster is also the name of a long pillow you might use to make your back feel better. And the two uses are not dissimilar. When you bolster your friends, you support them and prop them up, just like the pillow does for your back. When you're trying to bolster your credibility, you find people and/or documents that support you or your view. Bolster efforts to learn this word!", "MEANING: adjective.- not tractable; difficult to manage or mold SENTENCE: Can't manage your stubborn little brother who won't do what anyone says? You could call him intractable, or you could call your mother. Problems are intractable when they can't be solved. MNEMONIC: Intractable means not tractable. Helpful, right? No? Let's break it down. In both words you see the word tract. A contract is a written document that explains how a legal situation is to be managed together. When someone is tractable they are able to be managed or handled. When they are intractable, they are as unmanageable as a hungry two-year old.", "MEANING: adjective.- taxing to the utmost; testing powers of enduranceadjective.- difficult to accomplish; demanding considerable mental effort and skilladjective.- characterized by effort to the point of exhaustion; especially physical effort SENTENCE: Use the adjective arduous to describe an activity that takes a lot of effort. Writing all those college essays and filling out the applications is an arduous process! MNEMONIC: Arduous was first used in English to mean \"steep\" or \"difficult to climb.\" If you're an outdoorsman, hiking up a mountain is a lot of fun, but if you're a couch potato, it's an arduous trek. Today, the word can be used figuratively for something that is difficult or takes a lot of work. If you spend an arduous week studying for your final exams, you'll do well because you've worked really hard!", "MEANING: verb.- make stronger or defensibleverb.- reinforce with a buttressnoun.- a support usually of stone or brick; supports the wall of a building SENTENCE: You can buttress an argument with solid facts or your financial portfolio with safe investments. You may find that giving compliments to everyone you meet buttresses your popularity. To buttress is to sustain or reinforce. MNEMONIC: A buttress is a structure that adds stability to a wall or building, and this innovation played a significant role in the evolution of architecture. Think of a medieval cathedral. It's an incredibly tall, open building filled with light from vast windows. Without buttresses supporting the walls and carrying the weight of the ceiling away from the building and down to the ground, this cathedral would be impossible. Picture this when you use buttress figuratively as a verb meaning to strengthen and support.", "MEANING: adjective.- caused by or altered by or manifesting disease or pathologyadjective.- caused by or evidencing a mentally disturbed conditionadjective.- of or relating to the practice of pathology SENTENCE: If something is caused by a physical or mental disease, it is pathological. Someone with a pathological compulsion for cleanliness might scrub the floors for hours every night. MNEMONIC: Pathological comes from a Greek word, pathologikos, which means \u201ctreating of diseases\u201d \u2014 pathos means \"suffering.\" Anyone who studies or works with diseases, from their causes to their symptoms, identifies how the disease affects its victims, in other words, its pathological effects. Remember that this is a medical distinction. If a person has, for example, obsessive-compulsive disorder, his or her repetitive actions are pathological.", "MEANING: adjective.- completely free from dirt or contaminationadjective.- immaculately clean and unused SENTENCE: If something is pristine it's immaculately clean or has never been used. So please check your shoes before walking on a pristine white carpet. MNEMONIC: A long, long time ago pristine was used to describe primitive or ancient things. It wasn\u2019t until 1899 that the word grew to mean \"unspoiled\" or \"pure.\" Ecologists strive to preserve pristine rain forests, just as vacationers are always looking for a pristine strip of beach to lounge on. A new car should arrive to you in pristine condition, and hopefully you'll do your best to keep it that way.", "MEANING: verb.- detect with the senses SENTENCE: If you can make out, pick out, or distinguish something, you can discern it. This is a word for recognizing and perceiving things. MNEMONIC: Discerning has to do with being able to see or hear something. In a loud room, it can be hard to discern one person's voice. If there's not much light, you'll have trouble discerning the words on a page well enough to read. If you have sloppy handwriting, then it's hard to discern what you wrote. When you can discern something, you can tell what it is; you can identify it.", "MEANING: adjective.- able to make or detect effects of great subtlety; sensitiveadjective.- unobtrusively perceptive and sympatheticadjective.- quick to understandadjective.- having or revealing keen insight and good judgment SENTENCE: Discerning people pick up on subtle traits and are good judges of quality \u2014 they're the ones who can tell if your cupcakes are homemade from the finest ingredients or totally from a box mix. MNEMONIC: Discerning is an adjective that comes from the Old French discerner, meaning to \u201cdistinguish (between), separate (by sifting)\u201d \u2014 which makes sense, because someone with discerning tastes or a discerning eye is good at distinguishing the good from the bad and sifting out the gems from the junk. If you're an ace at picking out fabulous fabrics, accessories, and shoes when you get dressed each morning, you probably have discerning fashion sense.", "MEANING: adjective.- skillful in statecraft or managementadjective.- acutely insightful and wise SENTENCE: Use the formal adjective sagacious to describe someone who is wise and insightful like an advisor to the president or a Supreme Court justice. MNEMONIC: Someone like an inspirational leader or an expert in a field who seeks knowledge and has foresight can be described as sagacious. If you comment on something at a deeper level, you are making a sagacious observation. The word is a descendent of Latin sagus \"prophetic\" and is related to the Old English word seek. Synonyms include discerning, insightful and another formal word perspicacious.", "MEANING: verb.- reduce in scope while retaining essential elementsverb.- lessen, diminish, or curtail SENTENCE: So the editor wants to cut your epic 800-page history of the stapler to a 150-page summary instead. Don't cry \u2014 he just wants to abridge your masterpiece, trimming it down to the more readable essential elements. MNEMONIC: Synonymous with abbreviate, condense and cut short, abridge comes from the Latin word abreviare, which means \"to shorten.\" Although it's usually used in reference to wordy texts, one can also abridge or shorten a piece of clothing; a miniskirt is just an abridged version of the old floor length hoop skirt, for example. But abridging something isn't always good: If your civil rights are abridged, they've been lessened in some way.", "MEANING: noun.- a state of comatose torpor (as found in sleeping sickness)noun.- weakness characterized by a lack of vitality or energynoun.- a feeling of lack of interest or energy SENTENCE: If you are feeling lassitude, you're weary and just can't be bothered. Couch potatoes make lassitude into an art form. MNEMONIC: Lassitude might sound like latitude, but the two words don't mean the same thing. Latitude describes the distance of a particular location from the equator. Lassitude is the weariness you'd experience after attempting to run a marathon around the equator. Lassitude can also describe a lack of interest, like deciding you'd rather lie on your couch than run that marathon along the equator.", "MEANING: verb.- lose interest or become bored with something or somebodyverb.- exhaust or get tired through overuse or great strain or stressadjective.- physically and mentally fatigued SENTENCE: Weary as an adjective means \"very tired or worn out,\" like weary students who finished a long week of studying and taking tests. MNEMONIC: Weary comes from the Old English word werig, meaning \"tired.\" It can also describe being extremely bored and sick of something, like on a long drive, you might grow weary of your father's singing voice. As a  verb, weary means \"to exhaust or wear out,\" like when the children you are babysitting weary you with their game of running away every time you tell them to get ready to leave the park.", "MEANING: adjective.- lacking wit or imaginationnoun.- a person who travels by foot SENTENCE: A pedestrian is someone traveling by foot. If you're a pedestrian, you will likely get annoyed at the drivers who don't stop so you can cross the street. MNEMONIC: Pedestrian comes from the Latin pedester meaning \"going on foot\" but also \"plain.\" As a noun, it's someone walking around \u2014 sidewalks are for pedestrians. As an adjective it means \"lacking wit or imagination.\" If someone calls your new poem pedestrian, they mean it's dull. If you want to impress your friends while also making them feel worthless, mutter \"these people are SO pedestrian,\" at a party, loud enough for everyone to hear.", "MEANING: noun.- lack of agreement or harmonynoun.- bitter conflict; heated often violent dissension SENTENCE: Strife is the act or state of fighting or arguing violently. The years leading up to the U.S. Civil War were characterized by great strife between northern and southern states over slavery and the role of a federal government. MNEMONIC: This word applies to major issues and events, such as war and religious conflict: a period of civil strife. Like its Old French source, the original meaning of the English noun strife and the English verb strive had to do with an argument or quarrel. But the verb strive has lost that earlier sense, and now means to try hard to do or achieve something.", "MEANING: noun.- a conflict of people's opinions or actions or charactersnoun.- the auditory experience of sound that lacks musical quality; sound that is a disagreeable auditory experiencenoun.- disagreeable sounds SENTENCE: Disagreeable sounds can be called dissonance. You know it's dissonance if you have the strong desire to cover your ears with your hands. MNEMONIC: Racket, noise, dissonance \u2014 all can describe sounds that are not pleasant. While some musicians purposely add a little dissonance into their melodies to create an unexpected sound, others, like someone who just started drum lessons, creates dissonance by accident. Dissonance can also be a conflict between people or opinions, like the dissonance you feel when you want to do something but your parents say \"no.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- tending to betray; especially having a treacherous character as attributed to the Carthaginians by the Romans SENTENCE: If someone accuses you of being perfidious, you should probably be offended \u2014 it means underhanded, treacherous, deceitful \u2014 even evil. MNEMONIC: If you betray people often, you're perfidious: traitors are extremely perfidious. Besides betrayal, this word implies lying and maybe other kinds of awful behavior, like stealing and taking bribes. Everyone tries to avoid perfidious people. Perfidious is kind of an old-fashioned word, but being perfidious will never go out of style, unfortunately.", "MEANING: adjective.- (often followed by `for') ardently or excessively desirousadjective.- marked by active interest and enthusiasm SENTENCE: Avid usually means very eager or enthusiastic. If you're an avid reader, it means you read as much as you can, whenever you can. MNEMONIC: But this adjective can also mean wanting something so much that you can be thought of as greedy. For example, a person can be avid for success or power. Avid is from French avide, from Latin avidus, from avere \"to desire, crave.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- intended to placateadjective.- making or willing to make concessions SENTENCE: If you're in a fight with a friend and you want to end it, you should make a conciliatory gesture, such as inviting her to a party you're having. Conciliatory describes things that make other people less angry. MNEMONIC: The context is often a situation in which a dispute is settled by compromise. A synonym is propitiatory, though this adjective usually refers to avoiding the anger of someone who has the power to harm. In the word conciliatory, the \u2013ory suffix means \"relating to or doing,\" and the root is from Latin conciliatus, from conciliare \"to bring together, win over,\" from concilium \"council.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- acutely insightful and wiseadjective.- mentally acute or penetratingly discerning SENTENCE: Perspicacious is an adjective that means \"shrewd\" and \"wise.\" A perspicacious child can't be fooled when her parents try to keep a secret by talking in Pig Latin. MNEMONIC: The adjective perspicacious is a long word for a short definition: \"keen\" or \"shrewd.\" This word is descended from the Latin word perspicere, which means \"to look closely.\" In other words, if you look closely at something you are paying attention to it and know it well. A definition of perspicacious that is out of date but still relevant is \"having keen eyesight\" and people who can see clearly are also aware and attentive!", "MEANING: adjective.- used of personsadjective.- marked by practical hardheaded intelligence SENTENCE: If you are shrewd in your spending, you can make a small salary go a long way. Use the adjective shrewd to describe a person or thing that is smart or clever in a practical sort of way. MNEMONIC: The word shrewd is from a Middle English adjective formed from the noun schrewe \"an evil person, a villain.\" This Middle English noun is an earlier form of our modern English word shrew. So shrewd and shrew are related to each other. Shrewd doesn't usually have a disapproving or negative tone, but shrew certainly does.", "MEANING: noun.- a scolding nagging bad-tempered womannoun.- small mouselike mammal with a long snout; related to moles SENTENCE: Use the noun shrew \u2014 at your own risk \u2014 to refer to a woman who is argumentative, nagging, and ill tempered. MNEMONIC: The noun shrew can also refer to a mouse-like animal with tiny eyes, a long snout, and a sharp bite. Superstitions associated with this small mammal led people in the thirteenth century to use the word shrew to describe a spiteful person, male or female. The word later came to be used to describe a nagging, ill-tempered woman, as in William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Unless you are a famous dead author, however, you may want to steer clear of this one in conversation: it\u2019s considered offensive.", "MEANING: verb.- tear into shredsnoun.- a tiny or scarcely detectable amountnoun.- a small piece of cloth or paper SENTENCE:  MNEMONIC: ", "MEANING: adjective.- continually complaining or faultfinding SENTENCE:  MNEMONIC: ", "MEANING: adjective.- perceiving the significance of events before they occur SENTENCE: To be prescient is to have foresight or foreknowledge. We can use this word to describe people themselves, or what they say or do at a given moment. MNEMONIC: You probably know that the Latin prefix pre- means \"before,\" so you might be able to figure out that the word prescient, from the verb praescire, means to \"know beforehand.\" People like economists, sports commentators, and political analysts often get tagged with this word, because it's part of their job to sift through the data and make predictions \u2014 and sometimes they get it right. And when they're not just lucky, we might say they're prescient.", "MEANING: verb.- command against SENTENCE: To proscribe something is to forbid or prohibit it, as a school principal might proscribe the use of cell phones in class. MNEMONIC: Proscribe sounds similar to the word prescribe, but be careful: these words are essentially opposite in meaning. While proscribe means forbid, prescribe is used when a doctor recommends a medicine or remedy. Of course, if you want an excuse for not following your doctor\u2019s orders, you could say you were confused about the meaning of these two words \u2014 but that would be lying, which is proscribed by most people\u2019s value systems. And it would also be bad for your health.", "MEANING: adjective.- lasting a very short timenoun.- anything short-lived, as an insect that lives only for a day in its winged form SENTENCE: Something that is fleeting or short-lived is ephemeral, like a fly that lives for one day or text messages flitting from cellphone to cellphone. MNEMONIC: Ephemeral (\u0259-FEM-\u0259r-\u0259l) was originally a medical term with the specific meaning \"lasting only one day,\" as a fever or sickness (Hemera means \"day\" in Greek.) The word became more general, coming to mean \"lasting a short time,\" covering the life spans of plants or insects and then eventually anything that is fleeting or transitory. A related word is the plural noun ephemera, meaning \"things that are meant to last for only a short time.\" Posters for a rock concert are often ephemera, unless the band is so famous that they get saved and sold on eBay.", "MEANING: verb.- make less rigid or softerverb.- make more temperate, acceptable, or suitable by adding something else; moderateverb.- cause to be more favorably inclined; gain the good will of SENTENCE: To mollify is to calm someone down, talk them off the ledge, make amends, maybe even apologize. MNEMONIC: Mollify comes from the Latin mollificare to \"make soft,\" and that's still at the heart of the word. When you mollify someone, you smooth things over, even if you're maybe still a little mad: \"I was angry that the guy took my seat, but I was mollified when he offered me one closer to the band.\" Unlike the sharp sounds of antagonize, there are only soft sounds in this word that means to make someone feel soft and cuddly. Although dryer sheets might soften your clothes, they don't mollify them (unless your clothes were really mad at you before).", "MEANING: adjective.- (pathology) not presently activeadjective.- potentially existing but not presently evident or realized SENTENCE: Latent is an adjective that you use to describe something that is capable of becoming active or at hand, though it is not currently so. MNEMONIC: The adjective latent is a tricky word to define because it refers to something there but not there. That is, latent means something that is capable of becoming active or at hand but has not yet achieved that state. The word arrived in Middle English from the Latin word lat\u0113re which means \"to lie hidden.\" It can have somewhat negative connotations because it is often used in a medical context, as in a latent illness or infection, but it can also mean good things, such as someone discovering they have latent talents or capabilities.", "MEANING: adjective.- showing a brooding ill humor SENTENCE: A morose person is sullen, gloomy, sad, glum, and depressed \u2014 not a happy camper. MNEMONIC: When someone is morose, they seem to have a cloud of sadness hanging over them. This word is stronger than just sad \u2014 morose implies being extremely gloomy and depressed. We all can be morose at times, like after the death of a friend or family member. Whether you're morose due to an event or just because you're feeling blue, you should try skipping or whistling a little tune to perk things up.", "MEANING: verb.- act in advance of; deal with ahead of timeverb.- keep from happening or arising; make impossible SENTENCE: It takes a bit of planning to forestall something, meaning stop it from happening. To forestall the effects of aging, exercise and take care of your health all your life. MNEMONIC: You can break the word forestall into parts to figure out its meaning. The prefix fore is one you've seen in words like forewarn, which means \"to warn in advance.\" And you probably know that stall means \"delay.\" So to forestall is to stall in advance, or put another way, to try to prevent or put off something you don't want to happen.", "MEANING: adjective.- transmitting light; able to be seen through with clarityadjective.- capable of thinking and expressing yourself in a clear and consistent manneradjective.- having a clear mindadjective.- (of language) transparently clear; easily understandable SENTENCE: Something that's lucid is clear and understandable. Lucid writing is important in journalism, so that readers easily get the point of the article they're reading. MNEMONIC: When what you write or say is lucid, it's straightforward and its meaning is crystal clear. You can also use the adjective lucid to describe your mind or thoughts when you're thinking in a rational, sensible way: \"I was worried about my grandmother's confusion yesterday, but she seems really lucid today.\" Another meaning is \"translucent,\" or \"letting light shine through\" \u2014 which makes sense since lucid comes from the Latin lucidus, \"light or clear,\" with its root of lux, \"light.\"", "MEANING: verb.- cause to accept or become hardened to; habituate SENTENCE: To inure is to get used to something difficult or unpleasant. If after spending an hour in your brother's room, you stop noticing the stinky-sock smell, you have become inured to the odor. MNEMONIC: Although the Latin roots of inure mean \"in work,\" it may be easier to think of  \"in use\" when you see inure. Got new shoes that give you blisters? When they are \"in use\" long enough, your feet will become inured to the spots that rub, and while you may have calluses, you will not be in pain. You can be inured to more abstract things too. When weathermen constantly play up the next big snowstorm or blizzard, you become inured to it and stop paying attention to them.", "MEANING: adjective.- made tough by habitual exposure SENTENCE: If you have gotten so many mosquito bites in your life that they no longer bother you, you have become inured to them. This means you have become accustomed to tolerating them. MNEMONIC: This adjective is derived from the 16th-century phrase in ure, meaning \u201cin use\u201d or \u201cin practice.\u201d When you are inured to something, you have probably had a lot of persistent exposure to it, and it\u2019s usually something negative. People can become inured to pain, inured to violence, and even inured to the sound of a little yappy dog that won\u2019t stop barking.", "MEANING: noun.- a state of extreme poverty or destitution SENTENCE: Penury means extreme poverty to the point of homelessness and begging in the streets. Economic downturns, job loss, shopping sprees, and weekends at the high rollers' table in Vegas can lead to penury. MNEMONIC: Penury comes from the Latin word penuria, which, though it sounds like something contagious, actually means scarcity. It's not a word that turns up often in casual conversation or even on nightly newscasts. You're more apt to spot it in a college textbook or maybe an editorial in The New York Times.", "MEANING: noun.- a plant that is native to a certain limited areanoun.- a disease that is constantly present to a greater or lesser degree in people of a certain class or in people living in a particular locationadjective.- of or relating to a disease (or anything resembling a disease) constantly present to greater or lesser extent in a particular localityadjective.- originating where it is foundadjective.- native to or confined to a certain region SENTENCE: If you want to underscore just how commonly found and present something is within a particular place, try the word endemic. The saguaro cactus is endemic, or native, to the American southwest \u2014 so watch out for its sharp spines when you're hiking in Arizona! MNEMONIC: Although endemic meaning \"prevalent\" often describes a plant or disease, it can also refer to something less tangible and more unwanted such as violence or poverty. Many complain of endemic corruption in the local government. Despite its -ic ending, endemic can also be used as a noun to signify a plant or animal that is prevalent in a certain region. If an endemic is brought to another area which it takes over, destroying the local population, it's classified as an invasive species.", "MEANING: adjective.- informal or natural; especially caught off guard or unpreparedadjective.- characterized by directness in manner or speech; without subtlety or evasionadjective.- openly straightforward and direct without reserve or secretiveness SENTENCE: Straightforward and truthful talk might be described with the adjective candid.  If you're always candid, your parents will know that they can trust you. MNEMONIC: A serious-minded politician might suggest engaging in a \"candid discussion\" about a complicated topic like health care or the environment, because candid means \"open\" or \"frank.\" Remember that TV show Candid Camera? It was called that because its hidden cameras supposedly showed a candid view of reality. In photography, candid has become a noun meaning \"an unposed photo.\" The word comes from Latin candidus, meaning \"white,\" which was later extended to mean \"pure.\" Candid talk provides the pure, unvarnished truth.", "MEANING: verb.- block passage through SENTENCE: Occlude means to obstruct, as with an opening. You hear this a lot in a medical context. Heart surgeons are looking for occlusions in blood vessels \u2014 things that occlude the flow of blood. MNEMONIC: Occlude does not exist only in a medical context. If you close the bathroom door so your little brother won't come in while you're trying out makeup with your friends, you're occluding the bathroom. Meanwhile, your makeup occludes your pores.", "MEANING: verb.- support or supply with referencesverb.- record in detailnoun.- (computer science) a computer file that contains text (and possibly formatting instructions) using seven-bit ASCII charactersnoun.- a written account of ownership or obligationnoun.- writing that provides information (especially information of an official nature)noun.- anything serving as a representation of a person's thinking by means of symbolic marks SENTENCE: A document is a piece of paper that contains official information. Don't you wish you had a document saying that the bank owed you $5 million? MNEMONIC: Document comes from the Latin verb meaning \"to teach,\" so a document instructs you with the information it contains. Legal documents such as contracts contain instructions on how the people signing it will act. Passports, driver\u2019s licenses and birth certificates are all official documents. As a verb, document means \"to record in detail,\" or \"offer supporting evidence for.\" If you call a company to complain about something, make sure to document your phone calls by noting the date you called, who you spoke to and what was said.", "MEANING: adjective.- showing unfeeling resistance to tender feelingsadjective.- stubbornly persistent in wrongdoing SENTENCE: Obdurate is a formal word meaning stubborn. If you want to major in English, but your parents are obdurate that you should go premed, they might go so far as to threaten not to pay your tuition. MNEMONIC: This adjective descends from Latin obdurare, \"to harden.\" A near synonym is adamant, from Latin adamas, \"hard metal, diamond.\" So both of these synonyms derive from the quality of hardness being associated with a stubborn personality.", "MEANING: verb.- come together so as to form a single productverb.- move or draw together at a certain locationverb.- approach a limit as the number of terms increases without limitverb.- be adjacent or come together SENTENCE: Use the verb converge to describe something that comes together at a common point: \u201cThousands of Elvis fans plan to converge on the small Arkansas town where unconfirmed sightings of the deceased superstar eating at a local barbeque restaurant had been widely reported.\u201d MNEMONIC: Two roads, a roomful of politicians, or a group of rabid fans \u2014 when things come together from different points they converge. Converge traces back to the Latin word vergere, meaning \u201cto bend or to turn.\" The prefix con- means \"with,\" a good way to remember that things that converge come together. Don't confuse it with diverge, which means the opposite: \"move away,\" because the prefix \u201cdis-\u201d means \u201capart.\u201d", "MEANING: noun.- the trait of lacking enthusiasm for or interest in things generallynoun.- an absence of emotion or enthusiasm SENTENCE: Use the noun apathy when someone isn't interested in the important things that are happening. You might feel apathy for the political process after watching candidates bicker tediously with one another. MNEMONIC: Although apathy is a lazy-sounding word indicating a lack of interest, action, or emotion, it has traveled through many languages to arrive in English. From the Greek apatheia, \"freedom from suffering\" or \"impassibility,\" apathy has existed in English since the 17th century. Not just one person, but a whole segment of the population can be accused of inaction or emotional detachment: the expressions voter apathy, student apathy, and consumer apathy show just how unenthusiastic groups of people can be.", "MEANING: adjective.- softly bright or radiant SENTENCE: Luminous means full of or giving off light. During the winter holidays, with all their emphasis on light, you can see luminous displays of candles everywhere. MNEMONIC: This word has several figurative meanings that are related to the basic sense of something shining. For example, luminous prose is clear and easily understood. And a luminous career is bright and inspiring. The Middle English adjective is from Latin luminosus, from lumen \"light.\"", "MEANING: verb.- preserve by removing all water and liquids fromverb.- lose water or moistureverb.- remove water fromadjective.- lacking vitality or spirit; lifeless SENTENCE: The verb desiccate means to dry out, dry up and dehydrate. It's helpful to desiccate weeds but certainly not crops. MNEMONIC: As anyone who's been stuck in the desert will tell you, being desiccated by the burning sun isn't much fun. Stemming from the Latin word desiccare, which means to \"dry up,\" desiccate also means to preserve something by drying it out. Without desiccation, raisins or beef jerky would not be possible!", "MEANING: noun.- liveliness and eagerness SENTENCE: Someone with alacrity shows cheerful willingness and eager behavior, like a kid whose mother has told him he can buy anything in a candy store. MNEMONIC: While the noun alacrity normally refers to someone's peppy behavior, it can also describe a certain mood or tempo of a musical composition, indicating how the music should be played. Alacrity comes from the Latin alacritas, and the Italian musical term allegro is a near relation.", "MEANING: adjective.- impossible to avoid or evade:\"inescapable conclusion\" SENTENCE: Huh? Are you scratching your head at this word? The ineluctable conclusion is that you haven't the faintest idea what it means. Ineluctable means impossible to avoid. MNEMONIC: A five syllable beauty like ineluctable is obviously not the kind of word you throw around in daily speech. It's far more often used as a written word, as in the common phrase \"ineluctable conclusion.\" Used interchangeably with the more common unavoidable, though ineluctable implies an unsuccessful attempt to battle against whatever is ineluctable: after all, it comes from the Latin word \"to struggle.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- intended to deceiveadjective.- based on an incorrect or misleading notion or informationadjective.- containing or based on a fallacy SENTENCE: Something fallacious is a mistake that comes from too little information or unsound sources. Predictions that the whole state of California will snap off from the rest of North America and float away have proven to be fallacious \u2014 for now, anyway. MNEMONIC: Fallacious comes ultimately from the Latin fallax, \"deceptive.\" The word fallacious might describe an intentional deception or a false conclusion coming from bad science or incomplete understanding. A tween's assumption that anyone over 20 can't understand her situation would be fallacious; we have all been young once too.", "MEANING: adjective.- showing lack of artadjective.- (of persons) lacking art or knowledgeadjective.- characterized by an inability to mask your feelings; not deviousadjective.- simple and natural; without cunning or deceit SENTENCE: Yes, artless could mean lacking in art, but more often it means lacking in superficiality or deceit. An artless person could never make a living as a con artist. MNEMONIC: Originally meaning \"unskillful\" or \"uncultured,\" artless evolved into meaning not skilled or cultured in the art of deceit. If you are artless, you are natural and uncontrived. Young people, animals, the socially inept \u2014 these can all be artless in the way they express themselves. They seem to mean exactly what they say.", "MEANING: noun.- the closing section of a musical composition SENTENCE: A coda is a concluding segment of a piece of music, a dance, or a statement. It's usually short and adds a final embellishment beyond a natural ending point. Like this. MNEMONIC: Coda comes from the Latin word cauda, meaning \"tail,\" and it's good to think of it as a tail tacked onto something that in and of itself is already a whole. If you tell a story about your crazy experience getting lost in the country and sleeping at a farmer's house, you might add, as a coda, that the farmer ended up visiting you too, a year later.", "MEANING: noun.- a person who seems to be displaced in time; who belongs to another agenoun.- an artifact that belongs to another timenoun.- the act of locating something at a time when it could not have existed or occurred SENTENCE: An anachronism is something that doesn't fit its time period, like if you say you'll \"dial\" your smartphone. MNEMONIC: Anachronism comes from the Greek roots ana- which means \"against\" and chron- which means \"time.\" Together they represent a situation in which something happens that should not because it belongs to another time period. You see anachronisms all the time in the movies \u2014 they occur when you see a jet fly over a Civil War battle! Or knights jousting over a maiden during the time of Shakespeare!", "MEANING: adjective.- lacking grace in movement or posture SENTENCE: Gawky people are awkward and uncoordinated, like giraffes doing ballet. Teenagers often feel gawky when their arms and legs grow faster than the rest of them. MNEMONIC: If you've ever felt awkward and clumsy, tripping over your own feet as you head down the hall or bumping your head on your open locker, you know what it's like to feel gawky. This adjective comes from the 16th century phrase gawk hand, or \"left hand.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- not easily irritatedadjective.- (of a body of water) free from disturbance by heavy waves SENTENCE: Call a body of water placid if it has a smooth surface and no waves. Call a person placid if they don't tend to make waves by causing a fuss. MNEMONIC: Coming from the Latin placidus \"pleasing or gentle,\" placid is most commonly used to describe a person who is not easily irritated or a body of water such as a lake that does not have waves to disturb the surface. Synonyms of placid in both meanings include calm, serene and tranquil. In other uses, placid describes something with little disruption \u2014 like \"a placid neighborhood.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- found in the ordinary course of events SENTENCE: Quotidian is a fancy way of saying \"daily\" or \"ordinary.\" Quotidian events are the everyday details of life. MNEMONIC: When you talk about the quotidian, you're talking about the little things in life: everyday events that are normal and not that exciting. Going to the store, doing chores, working or going to school, and brushing your teeth are all quotidian. If you take a spaceship to Mars, that would be unusual and extraordinary: the opposite of quotidian.", "MEANING: adjective.- open to doubt or debateadjective.- making great mental demands; hard to comprehend or solve or believe SENTENCE: Something problematic poses a problem or causes difficulties. Your ambitions to become the next great leader of Spain are great, but your inability to speak Spanish might prove problematic. MNEMONIC: Around 1600, the word problematical was shortened and problematic was born. Perhaps they wanted to make it less problematic for spellers. It's an adjective that means tough, hard to solve, or even questionable. A flat tire in the middle of the desert would certainly be problematic, as would a star witness with a history of telling lies.", "MEANING: adjective.- impervious to pleas, persuasion, requests, reasonadjective.- not to be placated or appeased or moved by entreaty SENTENCE: When a person is inexorable, they're stubborn. When a thing or process is inexorable, it can't be stopped. MNEMONIC: This is a word for people and things that will not change direction. An inexorable person is hard-headed and cannot be convinced to change their mind, no matter what. You can also say that a process, like the progress of a deadly illness, is inexorable because it can't be stopped. A speeding train with no brakes is inexorable; it's not stopping till it crashes. When you see the word inexorable, think \"No one's stopping that.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- (of persons) free from external control and constraint in e.g. action and judgmentadjective.- (of political bodies) not controlled by outside forcesadjective.- existing as an independent entity SENTENCE: Autonomous describes things that function separately or independently. Once you move out of your parents' house and get your own job, you will be an autonomous member of the family. MNEMONIC: This adjective autonomous is often used of countries, regions, or groups that have the right to govern themselves: Vatican City, where the Catholic pope lives, is an autonomous territory located within the city limits of Rome. The corresponding noun is autonomy, referring to the state of existing or functioning independently. Autonomous comes from the Greek roots autos, \"self,\" and nomos, \"law.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- not in keeping with accepted standards of what is right or proper in polite society SENTENCE: Something that is inappropriate or unacceptable behavior is unseemly. It's a gentler, somewhat nicer word for \"inappropriate\" than its synonyms, the \"in\" words: \"indecent, indecorous, indelicate, inelegant, inept\" \u2014 well, you get the idea. MNEMONIC: Knowing that the \"un-\" prefix turns a word into its opposite, you'll see that unseemly means \"not seemly.\" Let's look at that word (which is related to our verb seem), because it carries the real meaning. Seemly goes back to around 1200, to the Old Norse word soemr, \"fitting, becoming.\" The negative \"un-\" was added in the early 14th century to denote the opposite meaning. \"Seems\" to make sense, doesn\u2019t it?", "MEANING: adjective.- being present everywhere at once SENTENCE: It's everywhere! It's everywhere! When something seems like it's present in all places at the same time, reach for the adjective ubiquitous. MNEMONIC: \"Cities like Singapore aim to cloak themselves in ubiquitous, free Wi-Fi in the next few years,\" The Wall Street Journal reported recently \u2014 meaning that those savvy Singaporeans will find a wireless connection everywhere they go. The word comes from the Latin ubique, meaning \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 \"everywhere.\" The usual pronunciation is \"yoo-BIK-wih-tihs,\" but Joseph Heller must have had the older variant \"ooh-BIK-wih-tihs\" in mind when he wrote in Catch-22 that a character \"padded through the shadows fruitlessly like an ubiquitous spook.\"", "MEANING: noun.- powerful and effective language SENTENCE: Eloquence is powerful, moving, magnificent use of language. Simply put, if you have eloquence, then you're one smooth talker. MNEMONIC: The noun eloquence has roots in the Latin word eloqui, meaning to \"speak out\". But we're not talking about just any regular speech here. Eloquence is marked by fluency, persuasiveness and the power to stir emotions. The eloquence of your dog trainer\u2019s empowering speech about the need for complementary manicures and pedicures for pets might bring you to tears, for example.", "MEANING: verb.- express a negative opinion of SENTENCE: If you haven't got anything nice to say, then it's time to disparage someone. It means to belittle or degrade a person or idea. MNEMONIC: Disparage is a specific way to describe a certain kind of insult, the kind that secures the insulter's place as superior. It often refers to an opinion or criticism lobbed in print or via word of mouth, not necessarily an act done to someone's face. If someone or something is being disparaged, you will often find a competing interest in the wings.", "MEANING: verb.- mistake one thing for anotherverb.- be confusing or perplexing to; cause to be unable to think clearly SENTENCE: If you have an identical twin, you've probably tried dressing alike so that people confound you with, or mistake you for, one another. You've also probably learned that, unfortunately, this trick doesn\u2019t work on your mom. MNEMONIC: The verb confound means both \"to mistake\" and \"to confuse.\" If you decide to treat yourself to a delicious dessert, you might find yourself confounded by the overwhelming number of choices. If you end up ordering the chocolate cake but the waiter brings you chocolate mousse, the waiter has somehow confounded those two options. Another meaning you may come across in literature is \"to damn,\" as in \"Confound it! You are the most exasperating person on the planet.\"", "MEANING: verb.- get betterverb.- make better SENTENCE: To ameliorate is to step in and make a bad situation better. You could try introducing a second lollipop to ameliorate a battle between two toddlers over a single lollipop. MNEMONIC: The verb ameliorate comes from the Latin word meliorare, meaning \u201cimprove.\u201d Food drives can ameliorate hunger. An air conditioner can ameliorate the discomfort of a stiflingly hot summer day. A sympathy card can ameliorate grief. Family therapy can ameliorate severe sibling rivalry. Anything that can lift a burden or make something better can ameliorate.", "MEANING: adjective.- marked by extreme care in treatment of detailsadjective.- marked by precise accordance with details SENTENCE: People who are meticulous can be pretty annoying, what with their extreme attention to detail. But if that person is, say, your surgeon or your accountant, you'll want them to be meticulous. MNEMONIC: The Latin root of meticulous is metus, which means \"fear,\" so it's easy to see how eventually meticulous got its meaning. Someone who's meticulous is afraid of what will happen if they're not careful enough to get every detail right. \"Detail-oriented\" and \"perfectionist\" are other ways of descripting someone who cares deeply about the small things and about getting things exactly right, every time. Concert pianists must be meticulous, because audiences are always listening for wrong notes.", "MEANING: adjective.- difficult to penetrate; incomprehensible to one of ordinary understanding or knowledge SENTENCE: Abstruse things are difficult to understand because they are so deep and intellectually challenging. It might be hard to figure out how a toilet flushes but the technology that goes into making the Internet function is abstruse. MNEMONIC: The Latin roots of the word abstruse are about concealing or hiding something, which is a good way to remember the meaning of this word. It is useful when describing something that is overly confusing, or if someone is deliberately making a story or a situation more complicated than necessary. It sounds and looks like obtuse, but abstruse is almost its opposite. Obtuse is dull or lacking a sharpness of intellect. While Abstruse is president of the chess club, Obtuse is hanging out by the parking lot smoking cigarettes.", "MEANING: noun.- a blood-red coloradjective.- inclined to a healthy reddish color often associated with outdoor lifeadjective.- confidently optimistic and cheerful SENTENCE: If you're sanguine about a situation, that means you're optimistic that everything's going to work out fine. MNEMONIC: Sanguine is from Latin sanguis \"blood\" and originally meant \"bloody\" \u2014 in medieval medicine it described someone whose ruddy complexion was a sign of an optimistic outlook. That was back when people thought that \"bodily humors\" like blood were responsible for your attitudes. Now that we no longer believe in humors, sanguine has settled down as a fancy way to say someone is cheerfully confident.  Experts are frequently described as feeling sanguine about a political or economic situation \u2014 or not sanguine, if they think we're going to hell in a handbasket.", "MEANING: adjective.- having the sticky properties of an adhesiveadjective.- having a relatively high resistance to flow SENTENCE: Viscous means sticky, gluey and syrupy. So if something is viscous, you usually don't want to stick your fingers in it \u2014 that goes for boogers and maple syrup alike. MNEMONIC: Not quite a solid and not quite a liquid, scientists like to say that viscous things don't flow very easily. They glop and slug around slowly, sticking to whatever they come in contact with. Think of making a batch of Rice Krispie treats: One minute the marshmallows are solid little rounds; the next minute they're melted into a web of sticky white goo that's somehow attached itself to the Rice Krispies, the spoon, the countertops, your nose, the front door, and the dog.", "MEANING: verb.- place out of sight; keep secretverb.- generate and separate from cells or bodily fluids SENTENCE: Secrete is all about secrets. It means both \"to hide\" and \"to release.\" When you squeeze a lemon, it secretes juice. When you stuff your money in a mattress, you secrete it there. MNEMONIC: It's easy to remember that secrete's all about secrets when you see the word secret inside secrete. Imagine the first person who squeezed a lemon and secreted the juice. Probably felt like he'd discovered a secret stash of citrus goodness. If he was greedy, maybe he gathered all the lemons he could find and secreted them away in a box so no one else would learn the secret of the juice-secretion.", "MEANING: noun.- unrestrained merrymakingverb.- celebrate noisily, often indulging in drinking; engage in uproarious festivitiesverb.- take delight in SENTENCE: Revel means to take great pleasure. If you revel in something, you're not just pleased or even excited; you're overwhelmed by joy. MNEMONIC: It used to mean riotous merry-making. Now it means to bask in the self-reflected glow of your own pleasure. You revel in your victory lap after winning the race. Your brother is constantly on your case for being clumsy, so when he knocks down a table filled with glassware, you revel in it. Think of it as a high level of pleasure.", "MEANING: noun.- unrestrained merrymakingverb.- celebrate noisily, often indulging in drinking; engage in uproarious festivitiesverb.- take delight in SENTENCE: Revel means to take great pleasure. If you revel in something, you're not just pleased or even excited; you're overwhelmed by joy. MNEMONIC: It used to mean riotous merry-making. Now it means to bask in the self-reflected glow of your own pleasure. You revel in your victory lap after winning the race. Your brother is constantly on your case for being clumsy, so when he knocks down a table filled with glassware, you revel in it. Think of it as a high level of pleasure.", "MEANING: adjective.- uncertain how to act or proceed SENTENCE: Irresolute describes someone who feels stuck. A decision must be made, a plan acted on, but the irresolute person just doesn't know what to do. MNEMONIC: Resolute describes certainty. When someone is resolute, things get done: plans are made and carried out. But add the prefix ir to resolute and you get its opposite. An irresolute person isn't necessarily a slacker \u2014 he or she just doesn't know what to do. Maybe it's confusion. Maybe it's a matter of waiting for better information to come along. Either way, if someone is irresolute, you'll need to be patient \u2014 or willing to nudge him or her into action.", "MEANING: verb.- pronounce not guilty of criminal charges SENTENCE: To exonerate someone is to declare him not guilty of criminal charges. This word is pretty much only used in reference to proceedings in a court of law. A word with a similar meaning that might be familiar is \u201cacquit.\u201d MNEMONIC: When your next door neighbor was arrested for painting smiley faces on the front doors of all the houses on your block, evidence to exonerate him was discovered when the police found a young hooligan from the next street over with a basement full of paint canisters. The verb comes from the Latin exonerat-, meaning \u201cfreed from burden.\u201d A criminal charge is certainly a burden, and when you're exonerated, you're freed from that burden.", "MEANING: noun.- a person who professes beliefs and opinions that he or she does not hold in order to conceal his or her real feelings or motivesadjective.- fraudulent; having a misleading appearance SENTENCE: Whether you're talking about your attitude, a gigantic diamond, or that obnoxious guy's claims that he knows everything about quantum physics, you can use phony to say that something\u2019s not real. MNEMONIC: Use the adjective phony to describe anything that\u2019s fake. If you\u2019re making phony money in the basement, you\u2019ll be in trouble if you get caught using it. Phony has a noun version with a similar meaning. If you say someone or something is a phony, then you\u2019re saying it isn\u2019t what it pretends to be. Someone who\u2019s a phony isn\u2019t sincere, like your classmate who pretended to be your best friend just to try to steal your boyfriend.", "MEANING: noun.- wrongful conduct by a public official SENTENCE: Whenever you see the prefix \"mal-,\" you know it's not good. Malfeasance is bad behavior, especially from officials or people who should know better. MNEMONIC: If nothing else, the mal- in malfeasance will alert you to the fact that something bad is going on. If you know French, fease-, faise- will ring a bell, as it often means \"to do.\" You can probably then infer that malfeasance means \"to do bad.\" Today, it's usually a bad deed done by an official or an organization. You wouldn't accuse a dog who peed on the carpet of malfeasance, but you would accuse a mayor who took a bribe of malfeasance.", "MEANING: adverb.- without knowledge or intention SENTENCE: Inadvertently is an adverb that means \"without knowledge or intent,\" like when you inadvertently take someone else's coat from the coatroom because it looks just like yours. MNEMONIC: When you do something inadvertently, you don't mean to do it \u2014 you might inadvertently step in a puddle, leave something important at home, or hurt your friend's feelings. Some things that happen inadvertently aren't mistakes, though: They happen by chance. For example,  if you just happen to park your car at the exact place that blocks a bus from hitting a pedestrian, you've inadvertently saved a life.", "MEANING: verb.- warn strongly; put on guardverb.- admonish or counsel in terms of someone's behaviorverb.- take to task SENTENCE: To admonish is to scold. If you want to show someone you're not happy with his behavior, admonish him. MNEMONIC: Coming to English through Old French from the Latin admonere \"to advise, remind,\" admonish is always used with an eye on improving someone's behavior. The exact meaning of this formal verb varies in intensity depending generally on who is being corrected. If a child or subordinate is being admonished, it means \"scold\" or \"rebuke\" whereas if someone admonishes a person with equal standing, warn or advise are closer synonyms.", "MEANING: noun.- changing location by moving back and forthnoun.- indecision in speech or action SENTENCE: Vacillation is when you constantly change your opinion. It also refers to swinging back and forth physically. MNEMONIC: Both meanings of vacillation involve moving back and forth in some way. The first sense is what happens when a person is wishy-washy. If you want to go to a movie, then say you don\u2019t, then say you do after all, that\u2019s an example of vacillation. Politicians who flip-flop are known for their vacillation because they constantly change their opinions. Also, something that is swinging or swaying in the wind is vacillating, so the movement is a vacillation.", "MEANING: verb.- praise, glorify, or honor SENTENCE: To laud someone means to praise them extravagantly \u2014 usually in a very public manner. A music critic might laud a new song by calling it the best summer anthem ever created. MNEMONIC: The word laud is from the Latin word laudere, meaning \"to praise.\u201d To laud someone is to glorify them, or to sing their praises, even if you\u2019re not actually singing. Movie reviewers might laud Oscar-nominated films, and your high school principal might laud the class valedictorian at graduation.", "MEANING: adjective.- unproductive of successadjective.- producing no result or effect SENTENCE: When something fails to deliver a useful result, you can call it futile. Hopefully all the time you're spending studying vocabulary won't turn out to be futile! MNEMONIC: Futile comes from the Latin futilis, which originally meant \"leaky.\" Although we use futile to talk about more than buckets, the image of a leaky vessel is a good illustration of the adjective. Pouring water into a leaky bucket is futile.  Your exercise program will be futile if you don't stop chowing down on chocolate. Futile is fancier than its synonym useless. Other synonyms are fruitless or vain. The i can be either short (FYOO-t'l) or long (FYOO-tile).", "MEANING: adjective.- involving or likely to cause controversyadjective.- inclined or showing an inclination to dispute or disagree, even to engage in law suits SENTENCE: A contentious issue is one that people are likely to argue about, and a contentious person is someone who likes to argue or fight. MNEMONIC: Some issues \u2014 like abortion, the death penalty, and gun control \u2014 are very controversial. They're also contentious, because people tend to argue about them, and the arguments will probably go on forever. Contentious issues get people angry and in a fighting mood. On the other hand, some people always seem to be in a fighting mood, no matter what the issue is. People like that are contentious too.", "MEANING: verb.- gnaw into; make resentful or angry SENTENCE: Rankle is a cranky-sounding verb that means to eat away at or aggravate to the point of causing anger. If you want to rankle a cat, try splashing it with water and then putting it in the bathtub. MNEMONIC: Rankle goes back to the French verb rancler, which comes from an old word for \"festering sore,\" which paints a pretty negative picture of what it means to rankle. A sore that festers gets worse and worse, or more infected, and if you rankle someone, they will get more and more angry. \"Ankle\" rhymes with rankle, and if you were to prank a friend and hold him by his ankles over a trash can every day for a week, it would definitely rankle him.", "MEANING: noun.- an inoffensive or indirect expression that is substituted for one that is considered offensive or too harsh SENTENCE: Pardon me, but when a polite term is substituted for a blunt, offensive one, you should call it a euphemism. MNEMONIC: Euphemism is from Greek euphemismos, meaning \"good speech,\" and it's a way that we paper over uncomfortable things with more pleasant-sounding words. These days we tend to use euphemisms when talking about anything having to do with elimination of bodily waste: toilet, bathroom, and water closet were all originally euphemisms. The military is also notorious for using euphemisms, like saying \"neutralizing the target\" instead of \"killing someone.\"", "MEANING: verb.- enter into a log, as on ships and planesnoun.- the exponent required to produce a given numbernoun.- a written record of events on a voyage (of a ship or plane)noun.- a written record of messages sent or receivednoun.- measuring instrument that consists of a float that trails from a ship by a knotted line in order to measure the ship's speed through the waterverb.- cut lumber, as in woods and forestsnoun.- a segment of the trunk of a tree when stripped of branches SENTENCE: A log is the trunk of a tree minus the branches: logging is cutting down trees. A log is also a written record of something, and logging is keeping such a record. MNEMONIC: The first type of log is a tree that's been cut down with the branches stripped. Think of a log cabin: it's made up of logs. Logging is when trees are cut down for lumber. The other type of log is some type of written record or list of messages. A ship captain keeps a log of notes on the ship's status and progress. When you make such a record, you're logging. Logging can be written or orally recorded.", "MEANING: adjective.- marked by harshly abusive criticism SENTENCE: Use the adjective vituperative to describe criticism that's so sharp it hurts. A vituperative review of a movie would make the director bitter for months. MNEMONIC: To correctly pronounce vituperative, remember that the first vowel sound is the long i sound, and the second syllable is accented: \"vie-TOO-per-uh-tive.\" Being vituperative takes criticism to the next level. Vituperative criticism is harsh, scathing, even abusive. If a review or assessment is vituperative, it doesn't say \"try harder next time.\" Instead it gives the sense of \"go away and never come back.\"", "MEANING: verb.- reduce in worth or character, usually verbally SENTENCE: To demean someone is to insult them. To demean is to degrade or put down a person or thing. MNEMONIC: If you noticed the word mean in demean, that's a good clue to its meaning. To demean someone is very mean. You are demeaning your sister or brother if you run their underwear up a flagpole. A teacher could demean a student by saying \"You're stupid!\" To demean is to insult: no one wants to be demeaned. Insulting language is often called demeaning. We can also say a bad president demeaned his office.", "MEANING: adjective.- all of the same or similar kind or nature SENTENCE: If a group of things are homogeneous, they're all the same or similar, like a room full of identically dressed Elvis impersonators. MNEMONIC: The adjective homogeneous comes from the Greek homogenes, meaning \u201cof the same kind.\u201d You can break down the root of the word further into two parts: homos, meaning \u201csame,\u201d and genos, meaning \u201ckind, gender, race, stock.\u201d It sounds very scientific, but if you look around the table at home and everyone is eating a bowl of oatmeal, you could safely describe your family\u2019s breakfast tastes as homogeneous.", "MEANING: verb.- exasperate or irritateverb.- make worse SENTENCE: For a formal-sounding verb that means to make worse, try exacerbate. If you're in trouble, complaining about it will only exacerbate the problem. MNEMONIC: Exacerbate is related to the adjective acrid, often used to describe sharp-smelling smoke. Think of exacerbate then as a sharp or bitter thing that makes something worse. A drought will exacerbate a country's food shortage. Worsen, intensify, aggravate and compound are similar, but exacerbate has the sense of an irritant being added in to make something bad even worse.", "MEANING: noun.- an opening remark intended to secure an advantage for the speakernoun.- a strategic maneuvernoun.- a chess move early in the game in which the player sacrifices minor pieces in order to obtain an advantageous position SENTENCE: A gambit is a strategic move, often in chess but also in politics or business, where a player sacrifices something up front for future gain. MNEMONIC: The noun gambit comes from an Italian word, gambetto, which means \u201ctripping up.\u201d When you make an opening move, offer something, or start a conversation with something that seems self-sacrificing but is really a ploy for greater advantage in the long run, that's a gambit. In chess, a gambit is when you sacrifice a pawn early for better positioning. When you offer to drive the morning carpool, that might be a gambit to get the afternoon shift off.", "MEANING: adjective.- preventing especially liquids to pass or diffuse through SENTENCE: If you have a waterproof raincoat, you could say that your coat is impermeable to the rain. Something that is impermeable does not allow water or liquid to pass through it. MNEMONIC: Made up of the prefix im-, meaning \u201cnot,\u201d and the adjective permeable, meaning \u201callowing to pass through,\u201d impermeable is used in much the same way as impervious or impenetrable. However, more so than these words, impermeable is especially associated with liquids and is often used in a scientific or technical context. Some gadgets, like waterproof watches and underwater cameras, are designed to be impermeable.", "MEANING: noun.- extreme greed for material wealthnoun.- reprehensible acquisitiveness; insatiable desire for wealth (personified as one of the deadly sins) SENTENCE: Avarice is a fancy word for good old-fashioned greed. It's one of what some call \"the seven deadly sins.\" MNEMONIC: Do you want more and more money? Or cookies? Or video games? Or anything? Then your heart is full of avarice, which you probably know better as greed. When people talk about greed, it's clearly not a good thing, but avarice has an even worse flavor to it. Avarice is often looked upon as a sin, and it's always considered despicable and evil.", "MEANING: adjective.- powerfully persuasive SENTENCE: When you make a cogent argument, it means your argument is clear and persuasive. In these days of 24-hour entertainment news and sound-bite sized explanations of complex government policy, it\u2019s hard to find a cogent argument amidst all the emotional outbursts. MNEMONIC: Cogent comes from a Latin word meaning to drive together, so cogent thinking is well-organized: it hangs together. If you try to convince your mayor to build a new park by saying that playgrounds are good, seeing the sky is nice, and raccoons are cool\u2026well that\u2019s not a cogent argument; it\u2019s just random. But you could cogently argue that parks contribute to civic happiness by providing space for exercise, community, and encounters with nature.", "MEANING: adjective.- lacking in harmonyadjective.- not in agreement or harmony SENTENCE: If you believe that movies should entertain, but your friend insists that movies should inspire, then the two of you hold discordant views on the purpose of movies. That means your opinions are in conflict. MNEMONIC: You can see the word discord in discordant. Discord is tension felt between people who strongly disagree about something. So discordant describes experiencing discord, a lack of harmony. A discordant conversation at your dinner table may make some people upset \u2014 they want everyone to get along. Discordant can also describe harsh and unpleasant sounds, like the blaring horns in city traffic.", "MEANING: noun.- a feeling of great (usually exaggerated) elation SENTENCE: Use euphoria to describe a feeling of great happiness and well-being, but know that euphoria often more than that\u2013\u2013it's unusually, crazy happy, over the top. MNEMONIC: Euphoria can even be classified as a mental illness. The earliest use of euphoria was to describe the relief provided by a medical procedure. The word was borrowed from New Latin, from the Greek word meaning \"ability to bear easily, fertility,\" from euphoros \"healthy,\" from the prefix eu- \"good, well\" plus pherein \"to bear.\"", "MEANING: noun.- wandering from the main path of a journeynoun.- a turning aside (of your course or attention or concern)noun.- a message that departs from the main subject SENTENCE: When your essay about French cooking starts describing a childhood trip to Disneyland, it's taken a digression \u2014 it's strayed from the main topic. MNEMONIC: \"But I digress\" is a phrase often used by people when they realize they're no longer \"on-topic.\" A digression is like a tangent, only digression often describes speech patterns, whereas tangent comes to us from mathematics. Another trick to remembering the meaning of digression is its relationship to the word progression. A progression is a series of ideas which proceeds in the same direction; a digression, logically enough, is an idea that goes off in another direction.", "MEANING: adjective.- showing sustained enthusiastic action with unflagging vitality SENTENCE: Someone who is indefatigable can go on for a very long time without becoming tired. You might not be so happy to have an indefatigable guide on your walking trip\u2013\u2013you'll have blisters, but she'll see no reason not to keep going. MNEMONIC: Indefatigable comes   from Latin indefatigabilis, formed from the prefix in- \"not\" plus defatigare \"to tire out.\" Here the prefix de- means \"entirely.\" You can remember the root fatigare because it sounds so much like the English fatigue.", "MEANING: noun.- a difficult problem SENTENCE: The tricky word conundrum is used to describe a riddle or puzzle, sometimes including a play on words or pun. MNEMONIC: One of the most famous conundrums is the riddle of the Sphinx, famously in the play Oedipus the King by Sophocles. Oedipus encounters the Sphinx, a mythical beast, who asks him, \"What walks on four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon, and three in the evening?\" The answer is \"A person\": crawling as a child, walking as an adult, and using a cane in old age. The scary thing is that if the Sphinx asked you the riddle and you didn't know, she'd eat you!", "MEANING: noun.- extreme oldnessnoun.- an artifact surviving from the pastnoun.- the historic period preceding the Middle Ages in Europe SENTENCE: If you find an antiquity, call a museum: you just found something very old. Antiquity can also mean the idea of oldness. MNEMONIC: The word antique should be a clue to the meaning of this word, which refers to things that are extremely old or ancient. This isn't grandparent old \u2014 this is really old, like hundreds or even thousands of years old. People also use this word to compare old ways of doing things to new ways: you could say an old-fashioned idea is an antiquity that goes against modernity (newer ideas and ways of doing things). Antiquity can also mean the time before the Middle Ages.", "MEANING: verb.- cause to be distrusted or disbelievedverb.- reject as false; refuse to acceptverb.- damage the reputation ofnoun.- the state of being held in low esteem SENTENCE: Discredit means to cause mistrust or cast the accuracy of something into doubt. If you say that schooling is important to you, but you never study, your actions discredit you and your words. MNEMONIC: You discredit what someone says when you choose not to believe it. You can discredit the rumors going around about your boyfriend if you are sure of his love. On a more personal level, you discredit people when you cast their authority or reputation into doubt. If you're running a tough race for class president, your opponent may try to discredit you by talking about your failures or even making up lies about you. But this would be to the discredit of your opponent \u2014 his or her own reputation would suffer for this bad behavior.", "MEANING: verb.- stand behind and guarantee the quality, accuracy, or condition ofverb.- show to be reasonable or provide adequate ground fornoun.- a type of security issued by a corporation (usually together with a bond or preferred stock) that gives the holder the right to purchase a certain amount of common stock at a stated pricenoun.- a writ from a court commanding police to perform specified actsnoun.- a written assurance that some product or service will be provided or will meet certain specificationsnoun.- formal and explicit approval SENTENCE: If you watch cop shows, you know that a warrant is something police need to get into your house \u2014 a permission slip from a judge. MNEMONIC: It's a noun! It's a verb! It's a word that warrants our attention! As a noun, it's the piece of paper they show you through the keyhole during an investigation. It's also a reason for doing something, or a promise (think of the warranty on your new car, the promise that it'll work for a certain amount of time). As a verb, it means to make something seem reasonable or necessary, such as when the ticking suitcase warrants bringing in the bomb squad, or when the teenager's sneaking in late again warrants a stricter curfew.", "MEANING: noun.- being twofold; a classification into two opposed parts or subclasses SENTENCE: A dichotomy is an idea or classification split in two. When you point out a dichotomy, you draw a clear distinction between two things. MNEMONIC: A dichotomy is a contrast between two things. When there are two ideas, especially two opposed ideas \u2014 like war and peace, or love and hate \u2014 you have a dichotomy. You often hear about a \"false dichotomy,\" which occurs when a situation is unfairly represented as an \"either/or\" scenario. For example, the statement \"All cars are either small and efficient or large and polluting\" creates a false dichotomy because there are some cars that don't fit into either category.", "MEANING: noun.- (mathematics) calculation of the value of a function outside the range of known valuesnoun.- an inference about the future (or about some hypothetical situation) based on known facts and observations SENTENCE: An extrapolation is kind of like an educated guess or a hypothesis. When you make an extrapolation, you take facts and observations about a present or known situation and use them to make a prediction about what might eventually happen. MNEMONIC: Extrapolation comes from the word extra, meaning \u201coutside,\u201d and a shortened form of the word interpolation. Interpolation might sound like a made-up word, but it\u2019s not. An interpolation is an insertion between two points. So an extrapolation is an insertion outside any existing points. If you know something about Monday and Tuesday, you might be able to make an extrapolation about Wednesday.", "MEANING: adjective.- (of a display) tawdry or vulgaradjective.- intended to attract notice and impress others SENTENCE: Reach for the adjective ostentatious when you want a flashy way to say \u2014 well, \"flashy\" or \"showy.\" MNEMONIC: No one wants to be described as ostentatious, a word whose cousins include pretentious, flamboyant, and gaudy. It originates from the Latin word ostentare, \"to display,\" but in English it's often used for displays of the crass or vulgar sort. A rapper's diamond-encrusted teeth might be an ostentatious display of \"bling,\" and someone wailing especially loudly at a funeral of a distant acquaintance might be making an ostentatious show of sorrow.", "MEANING: noun.- the use of tricks to deceive someone (usually to extract money from them) SENTENCE: Have you ever gotten the sense that politicians or corporate leaders will say anything to turn public opinion their way? This tricky kind of deceit and manipulation is called chicanery. MNEMONIC: Besides chicanery, another funny-sounding word for trickery is shenanigans. Whereas the former is always used in the singular and involves deceptive language, the latter is usually used in the plural and refers to the actions of a person. Your crazy neighbor is up to his old shenanigans if he has begun doing weird stuff again, but if a politician's chicanery is exposed, he will lose public trust and not be returned to office in the next election cycle.", "MEANING: adjective.- including markedly dissimilar elementsadjective.- fundamentally different or distinct in quality or kind SENTENCE: The trunk of some people's cars may contain items as disparate as old clothes, rotting food, and possibly a missing relative. Disparate things are very different from each other. MNEMONIC: Near synonyms are unequal and dissimilar. The adjective disparate is from Latin dispar\u0101tus, from dispar\u0101re \"to separate, divide,\" from the prefix dis- \"apart\" plus par\u0101re \"to prepare.\" Disparate in the sense of \"very different\" probably developed by association with the Latin adjective dispar \"unequal, different.\"", "MEANING: noun.- an abject cowardadjective.- lacking even the rudiments of courage; abjectly fearful SENTENCE: A craven man is no Superman or Spiderman, nor is he a firefighter or a soldier. A craven man is the opposite of those guys: he has not an ounce of courage. MNEMONIC: In \"The Wizard of Oz,\" the Cowardly Lion could have been called the Cravenly Lion, but that didn't sound quite right. Use craven as you would cowardly. A craven leader is scared to lead, while a craven gymnast stays on the mat and avoids the balance beam. You can also use the word to describe other things, besides humans. Craven policies, for example, are probably weak and do not take bold measures.", "MEANING: verb.- cause to grow or increase rapidlyverb.- grow rapidly SENTENCE: When something proliferates, it's growing, spreading or multiplying really quickly. Bunny rabbits have a habit of proliferating, as do dandelions in untended gardens and funny YouTube videos on the internet. MNEMONIC: Proliferate was originally a biological term used to describe the growth of cells and producing offspring. It wasn\u2019t until 1961 that we started to use proliferate more generally to talk about everything from the spread of nuclear weapons to the wide growth of Walmart. Other similar words include expand, reproduce, snowball, and spawn.", "MEANING: noun.- the spreading of the sea over land as evidenced by the deposition of marine strata over terrestrial stratanoun.- the action of going beyond or overstepping some boundary or limitnoun.- the act of transgressing; the violation of a law or a duty or moral principle SENTENCE: A transgression is something that is against a command or law. Whether you are cheating on a test, or cheating on a spouse, you are committing transgressions that are not easily forgiven. MNEMONIC: A transgression can be a failure to do your duty. A sin is a transgression against God. The noun transgression is from Middle English, from Middle French, from Latin \"act of crossing, passing over,\" from transgredi \"to step or pass over.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- precisely accurateadjective.- habitually speaking the truth SENTENCE: Someone who is veracious speaks the truth \u2014 like your brutally honest friend who always lets you know what she thinks about your outfits, your hairstyle, your lasagna recipe, and your taste in movies. MNEMONIC: Think of a veracious person as someone who is like a witness under oath in a court of law, someone who speaks \u201cthe truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\u201d Don\u2019t ask a question of a veracious friend unless you really want to know the answer. The adjective veracious can be applied not just to people but also to things that are true or accurate, such as \"a veracious story\" or \"a veracious statement.\"", "MEANING: noun.- the property of being smooth and shinyverb.- polish and make shiny SENTENCE: That seductive gleam on that Porsche behind the dealer's window? It's called a burnish, a gloss only achieved by loads of polishing. Likewise, you can burnish a resume by polishing it until it's perfect. MNEMONIC: A caution about usage: burnish in the physical sense is usually reserved for inanimate objects \u2014 a woman will not be happy to hear that her appearance is \"burnished to perfection.\" But your car will thank you. Also, one of the most common non-physical things to be burnished? A reputation. People are forever burnishing them \u2014 and its opposite, besmirching them (i.e., making them dirty).", "MEANING: adjective.- generous in assistance to the pooradjective.- doing or producing good SENTENCE: Beneficent is the type of act that helps others. If you're a beneficent person, you probably spend a lot of your time volunteering at soup kitchens or homeless shelters, helping people who are less fortunate than you are. MNEMONIC: Beneficent shares the same root and sentiment with its fellow adjective, benevolent, which also means something that is good. The two words are so closely related that they also share the same Latin origin. Another related word, benefactor, is someone who gives support to an organization or institution or someone who takes care of another person. Kind, generous, and giving are all synonyms of beneficent.", "MEANING: verb.- make real or concrete; give reality or substance toverb.- solidify, firm, or strengthenverb.- represent in bodily formverb.- establish or strengthen as with new evidence or facts SENTENCE: To substantiate is to give support to a claim. We\u2019d really like to believe in the Tooth Fairy; however, more evidence is needed to substantiate her existence (besides that quarter in your pocket). MNEMONIC: Substantiate is related to the word substantial, which means \"solid.\" So, to substantiate a claim is to make it solid or believable. If the evidence given in support of an argument is weak and unconvincing, that evidence can be described as insubstantial. Of course, in special cases like the Tooth Fairy, having substantial evidence doesn\u2019t seem to matter; fans just keep on believing.", "MEANING: adjective.- in the nature of something though not readily apparentadjective.- existing as an essential constituent or characteristic SENTENCE: Use the adjective inherent for qualities that are considered permanent or cannot be separated from an essential character. MNEMONIC: We use the adjective inherent to describe attributes that are part of the essential nature of something. It's different from you being tall, rather than being a description, it has to be a quality and this quality is unchangeable. So, for example, if you have never been able to eat spinach, you have an inherent dislike of it.", "MEANING: adjective.- marked by stubborn resistance to authorityadjective.- stubbornly resistant to authority or control SENTENCE: If someone is so pig-headed that he won't budge on an issue, call him recalcitrant. Not that it will make a difference... MNEMONIC: Recalcitrant is from Latin calcitrare, meaning \"to kick,\" so someone who is recalcitrant is kicking back against what's wanted of them. Synonyms are unruly, intractable, and refractory, all referring to what is difficult to manage or control. Writers are frequently referring to recalcitrant Democrats and Republicans, since many people are stubbornly loyal to their political parties and unwilling to change.", "MEANING: adjective.- auguring favorable circumstances and good luck SENTENCE: Use the adjective auspicious for a favorable situation or set of conditions. If you start a marathon by falling flat on your face, that's not an auspicious start. MNEMONIC: If something seems likely to bring success \u2014 either because it creates favorable conditions or you just consider it a lucky sign \u2014 label it auspicious. The word is related to auspice, \"a divine omen,\" an old word with a colorful history. In Latin, an auspex was a person who observed the flight of birds to predict things about the future. Luckily, you no longer have to be a bird-watching fortune-teller to guess whether something is auspicious or not.", "MEANING: noun.- a rate demonstrating an absence of haste or hurrynoun.- (usually plural) discussion of all sides of a questionnoun.- the trait of thoughtfulness in action or decisionnoun.- planning something carefully and intentionallynoun.- careful consideration SENTENCE: The process of carefully considering what to do is called deliberation, like your deliberation before making one of the most important decisions in your life. MNEMONIC: The noun deliberation comes from the Latin word deliberare, meaning \u201cweigh,\u201d or \u201cconsider well.\u201d Whenever a person or group needs to work through all of the possible solutions to a problem, this is deliberation. Something that is deliberate is done on purpose, not by chance or accident \u2014 deliberation carries this same spirit, in that it is a carefully thought-out process of making a decision.", "MEANING: verb.- make a preliminary introduction, usually to a formal documentnoun.- a preliminary introduction to a statute or constitution (usually explaining its purpose) SENTENCE: A preamble is a brief introduction to a speech, like the Preamble to the Constitution that starts out \"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union...do ordain and establish this Constitution.\" MNEMONIC: Preamble comes from the Latin praeambulus which means \"walking before.\" And that's what a preamble does \u2014 it \"walks\" before a speech, often explaining what's coming. It's like the White Rabbit introducing the Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland.  Since it goes before a speech, think of it as a pre-ramble.  A preamble is usually used for formal documents; you wouldn't include one in a text to your best friend.", "MEANING: adjective.- not subject or susceptible to change or variation in form or quality or nature SENTENCE: If you can't change it, it's immutable. There are many things in life that are immutable; these unchangeable things include death, taxes, and the laws of physics. MNEMONIC: The adjective immutable has Latin roots that mean \"not changeable.\" The Latin prefix for not is in, but the spelling changes when the prefix is put before the consonant m. It is im before a root word starting with m as in immutable. If you learn this rule, you'll know the immutable fact that immutable begins with i-m-m.", "MEANING: adjective.- intrusive in a meddling or offensive manner SENTENCE: Though officious sounds like official, it means being annoyingly eager to do more than is required. \"The officious lunch lady made everyone's food choices her business, and made nasty comments when students chose cookies over carrots.\" MNEMONIC: Officious is a tricky word as it seems like it might mean something like office or official. Instead, it is a word to describe someone that acts more official than they actually are. People who are officious are busybodies. They want to make their opinions known and followed, despite not having any kind of real power.", "MEANING: adjective.- based on pretense; deceptively pleasingadjective.- plausible but false SENTENCE: Use specious to describe an argument that seems to be good, correct, or logical, but is not so. We live on the earth, therefore the earth must be the center of the universe has been proven to be a specious theory of the solar system. MNEMONIC: Specious is pronounced \"SPEE-shuhs.\" Something that is specious is attractive in a deceptive way, and if you follow the word's etymology, you'll see why. In Middle English, this adjective meant \"attractive,\" from Latin speci\u014dsus \"showy, beautiful,\" from speci\u0113s \"appearance, kind, sort.\" Latin speci\u0113s is also the source of English species.", "MEANING: adjective.- having or showing profound knowledge SENTENCE: If you call someone erudite, that means they show great learning. After you've earned your second Ph.D., you will be truly erudite. MNEMONIC: Erudite is from Latin verb erudire, \"to teach,\" which comes from rudis for \"raw, unskilled, ignorant\" (the source of our word rude). If you bring someone out of a raw state, you educate them, so someone who is erudite is very educated indeed (and perhaps a bit of a showoff).  You can say either ER-oo-dite or ER-yoo-dite; the second one, being a bit harder to say, can seem a bit more erudite.", "MEANING: noun.- a trite or obvious remark SENTENCE: If an executive gives a speech that begins, \"This business is all about survival of the fittest. You need to burn the midnight oil and take one for the team,\" his employees might get sick of listening to these meaningless clich\u00e9s and tell him to cut the platitudes. MNEMONIC: The English language contains many old, worn-out clich\u00e9s, or platitudes. Phrases like \"ants in your pants\" and \"as American as apple pie\" are so overused that they've almost lost their meaning. People rely on these tired old remarks when they can't think of anything original to say. Be warned: if you throw too many platitudes into your conversations, people are eventually going to get tired of listening to you.", "MEANING: verb.- give a guarantee or promise ofverb.- make an oral contract or agreement in the verbal form of question and answer that is necessary to give it legal forceverb.- specify as a condition or requirement in a contract or agreement; make an express demand or provision in an agreement SENTENCE: To stipulate something means to demand that it be part of an agreement. So when you make a contract or deal, you can stipulate that a certain condition must be met. MNEMONIC: Anytime you draw up a legal agreement, you can stipulate a requirement that has to be met for that agreement to be complete. This stipulation might put some sort of limit on the agreement. For example, if you run a fencing company and offer a sale, you can stipulate that to get the sale price, the fence must be ordered by a certain date. Your customer, in turn, might stipulate that the work must be finished before the ground freezes.", "MEANING: adjective.- showing great reverence for godadjective.- feeling or showing profound respect or veneration SENTENCE: When you have great awe and respect for someone or something, and you show it by respectfully worshiping that person, thing, deity, or musical group, you are being reverent. MNEMONIC: Originally, the word reverent was used only in religious contexts, but now it works when people are just acting like they\u2019re in a religious setting (even if the object of their worship is a sports star or political pundit). People are occasionally reverent in regard to antique cars, supermodels, spelling bee champions and giant TV screens.  Reverent is related to the verb revere, which is also about having or showing respect for someone or something.", "MEANING: verb.- be beautiful to look atverb.- add details toverb.- make more beautifulverb.- make more attractive by adding ornament, color, etc. SENTENCE: The word \"bell\" shows up in the middle of embellish, and bells are something that decorate, or embellish something, making it more attractive. If you embellish speech, though, it can get ugly if you add a lot of details that aren't true. MNEMONIC: Embellish often has the positive meaning of adding something to make it more handsome or beautifully decorated. But, while adding bells to something looks great at first, after a couple of hours of bells ringing in the ears, what was meant to embellish and beautify can get annoying. That's what can happen when you embellish by adding too many false or exaggerated details to a story. Embellishing with true, colorful details and vivid descriptions is what can really enhance the beauty of a story.", "MEANING: noun.- the subsidence of swelling or other signs of inflammation (especially in a lung)noun.- (music) a dissonant chord is followed by a consonant chordnoun.- analysis into clear-cut componentsnoun.- (computer science) the number of pixels per square inch on a computer-generated display; the greater the resolution, the better the picturenoun.- the ability of a microscope or telescope to measure the angular separation of images that are close togethernoun.- finding a solution to a problemnoun.- the trait of being resolutenoun.- a formal expression by a meeting; agreed to by a votenoun.- something settled or resolved; the outcome of decision makingnoun.- a statement that solves a problem or explains how to solve the problemnoun.- a decision to do something or to behave in a certain manner SENTENCE: The noun resolution has a few related meanings having to do with being firmly determined about something. If you lack determination, you'll never fulfill your New Year's resolutions. MNEMONIC: Resolution is the noun form of the verb resolve, which comes from Latin resolvere, \"to loosen, undo, settle.\" We can still see this meaning in resolution, in the sense of \"an explanation\" or \"a solution\"; when a problem, conflict or mystery reaches its resolution, it has been \"undone,\" so to speak. Another common meaning is \"determination, resolve\": \"Jose approached the task with resolution.\"  A related sense is \"a decision to do something\": \"My resolution is to go to the gym three times a week.\"", "MEANING: verb.- overcome or allayverb.- cause to be more favorably inclined; gain the good will ofverb.- make peace with SENTENCE: Appease means to make or preserve peace with a nation, group, or person by giving in to their demands, or to relieve a problem, as in \"the cold drink appeased his thirst.\" MNEMONIC: Appease often implies abandoning your moral principles to satisfy the demands of someone who is greedy for power: think of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's attempt to appease the Nazis at Munich. The verb appease comes from the Old French apaisier, \"to pacify, make peace, or be reconciled,\" from the phrase \"a paisier,\" which combines a-, or \"to,\" and pais, \"peace,\" from the Latin pax.", "MEANING: verb.- burst inward SENTENCE: When something implodes, it explodes inward \u2014 instead of outward. With extremely large buildings, it helps to implode them rather than explode them, because by falling inward they take up less space. MNEMONIC: Why bother to have a word like implode when you already have explode? Well, imagine there is something deep beneath the sea, being subjected to the intense pressure there. If the pressure is high enough that the object bursts, it would collapse in rather than out. It would, in fact, implode. People also sometimes use implode to describe a person subjected to intense pressures who, emotionally at least, bursts inward: \"All that stress just made Jess implode.\"", "MEANING: noun.- state of disgrace resulting from public abusenoun.- a state of extreme dishonor SENTENCE: If you go against or oppose what's good, you might earn opprobrium \u2014 the opposite of getting attention for something good. Bad behavior leads to opprobrium. If you throw a soft drink off the theater balcony, the opprobrium might keep you from getting dates to the movies. MNEMONIC: Even though the words aren't related, the \"opp-\" of the word opprobrium sounds a bit like the \"app\" part of \"inappropriate.\" Opprobrium isn't an action that leads to disgrace, it's something that comes from the inappropriate thing that was done. A very inappropriate act leads to opprobrium for the person who did the act. \"Infamy\" \u2014 extreme dishonor, often with lasting consequences \u2014 is a synonym for opprobrium.", "MEANING: verb.- run away; usually includes taking something or somebody along SENTENCE: Abscond is to escape, often taking something along. As a kid, you may have absconded from your lemonade stand \u2014 with the coffee can of cash in hand, and your bewildered sister still filling cups for your customers. MNEMONIC: Abscond is generally used to describe someone running from law or capture, and the word abscond has been in use since the early sixteenth century \u2014 running away and hiding being nothing new. Dogs who get off the leash and dart into the woods are not necessarily absconding; they are simply making a break for it. On the other hand, the Ponzi schemer who went to live in the South of France with his client's money? He absconded.", "MEANING: adjective.- of an obscure nature( Inscrutability noun.- the quality of being impossible to investigate)SENTENCE: Any person or thing that's mysterious, mystifying, hard to read, or impossible to interpret is inscrutable. You ever notice how it's hard to tell what some people are thinking? Those folks are inscrutable. MNEMONIC: A good way to think about what inscrutable means is to consider cats and dogs. Dogs wear their hearts on their sleeves, shaking when they're afraid and bouncing up and down when they're happy. Dogs are definitely not inscrutable, because you can tell what they're thinking and feeling. On the other hand, cats are very difficult to read. Even longtime cat owners aren't always sure what's going on with their kitty. Cats are very inscrutable ", "MEANING: noun.- the object of a feeling of intense aversion; something to be avoidednoun.- a feeling of intense dislike SENTENCE: An antipathy is a deep-seated dislike of something or someone. Usually it's a condition that is long-term, innate, and pretty unlikely to change \u2014 like your antipathy for the Red Sox. MNEMONIC: If you look at the Greek roots of this word \u2014 anti- (\"against\") and pathos (\"feeling\") \u2014 you can see that antipathy is a feeling against someone or something. In general, antipathies are feelings that are kept at least somewhat under wraps and are not out in the open.", "MEANING: adjective.- requiring secret or mysterious knowledge SENTENCE: Something arcane is understood or known by only a few people. Almost everyone knows the basics of baseball, but only an elite few possess the arcane knowledge of its history that marks the true fan. MNEMONIC: A near synonym is esoteric, as in \"relating to remote information or knowledge.\" Experts in academic fields often show off the depth of their knowledge by mentioning some arcane and esoteric fact as if it was common for everyone to know. The origin of arcane is Latin arc\u0101nus, \"secret, closed,\" from arca, \"a chest, box.\" Arcana (singular arcanum) are pieces of mysterious knowledge or information.", "MEANING: verb.- become widerverb.- swell from or as if from internal pressureverb.- cause to expand as if by internal pressure SENTENCE: A soda and pizza binge might make your stomach distend, meaning your stomach will swell as a result of pressure from the inside. MNEMONIC: If you\u2019ve ever eaten too much food it won\u2019t surprise you to learn that the verb distend traces back to the Latin words dis-, meaning \u201capart,\u201d and tendere, meaning \u201cto stretch.\u201d Your stomach will certainly feel stretched out if you do something \u2014 like overeat \u2014 that causes it to distend. The word distend often applies to stomachs \u2014 a pregnancy would also cause a stomach to distend \u2014 but it can also refer to anything that is stretched out as a result of internal pressure.", "MEANING: verb.- imitate the function of (another system), as by modifying the hardware or the softwareverb.- compete with successfully; approach or reach equality withverb.- strive to equal or match, especially by imitating SENTENCE: When you emulate someone, you imitate them, especially with the idea of matching their success. MNEMONIC: When someone is impressive because of their great skills, brains, strength, or accomplishments, others will emulate them. To emulate is to imitate and model yourself after someone. People emulate role models \u2014 people they want to be like. After Michael Jordan retired from the NBA, player after player tried to emulate Jordan's game and success. It's hard to be as good as someone like that, but having a hero to emulate can be helpful in many areas of life.", "MEANING: adjective.- marked by harshly abusive criticism SENTENCE: Scathing means witheringly harsh. If you enter a singing contest and the judge says that your singing is like that of a toad with laryngitis, that is scathing criticism. MNEMONIC: Scathing comes from an old Norse verb, to scathe, which means to injure by fire or lightning. Now we use it when someone\u2019s critique is so harsh that it feels like you've been burned. If your best friend turns against you and advertises your faults to the world, and you feel like everyone is staring and talking about you, you are having a scathing experience.", "MEANING: adjective.- of or involving dispute or controversy SENTENCE: The adjective polemical describes something related to an argument or controversy. To keep the peace, avoid discussing politics at Thanksgiving, which usually deteriorates into a polemical argument with Uncle Bob. Better stick to football or apple versus pumpkin pie. MNEMONIC: Polemical is the adjective form of the noun polemic, which itself comes from the Greek word, polemos, meaning \"war.\" Use polemical to describe a controversy or argument that could end up as a huge conflict, because polemical refers to a major disagreement. The word is often used to describe speech and writing \u2014 a polemical discussion or a polemical essay \u2014 that usually starts a war of words.", "MEANING: adjective.- disposed or willing to comply SENTENCE: If you are willing to submit to someone's request, then you are compliant. Parents like it when their teenagers are compliant and follow the rules. Teenagers, on the other hand, are probably not as compliant as parents would like to think! MNEMONIC: The adjective compliant can also describe something that is agreeable. \"The lawyers made sure that the man's will was fully compliant with state law, so that his children could not contest his desire to leave his entire estate to his dog, Fluffy.\" Or: \"That software is not compliant with your operating system; you'll have to buy a different version.\"", "MEANING: noun.- a disposition or tendency to yield to the will of othersnoun.- a courteous expression (by word or deed) of esteem or regardnoun.- courteous regard for people's feelings SENTENCE: Sure you wear ripped jeans to school every day, but you don't wear them to your grandmother's house out of deference to her. When you show deference to someone, you make a gesture of respect. MNEMONIC: The noun deference goes with the verb defer, which means \"to yield to someone's opinions or wishes out of respect for that person.\" If you and your dad disagree about the best route to the grocery store, you might defer to him, and take his route. You're taking his route out of deference to his opinion and greater experience.", "MEANING: noun.- a feeling of anger and animositynoun.- small scales from animal skins or hair or bird feathers that can cause allergic reactions in some people SENTENCE: Dander is an animal's tiny flakes of skin. People who are allergic to cats are typically sensitive to their dander. MNEMONIC: Furry animals shed both hair and microscopic dander \u2014 and it's more common to be allergic to the dander. If you have dog allergies, your body overreacts to breathing in the dander of your best friend's chihuahua, making you sneeze. Another kind of dander is an angry or frustrated feeling, which shows up in the phrase \"get your dander up.\" You might say, \"My dander was up from the minute he made that offensive joke.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- confined to and understandable by only an enlightened inner circle SENTENCE: Pssst... do you know the secret handshake? If you haven't been brought into the inner circle of those with special knowledge, esoteric things will remain a mystery to you. MNEMONIC: In the olden days, achieving esoteric knowledge meant getting initiated into the mystical arts, learning secrets unknown to regular folks. Now when a subject is called esoteric it's usually something not so mystical but still hard to penetrate: financial accounting might seem esoteric for people who get easily stumped filling out their tax forms. Americans might find the sport of cricket to be esoteric, but the rules of baseball can be just as impenetrable to outsiders. The infield fly rule? Totally esoteric.", "MEANING: noun.- a disposition to behave in a certain waynoun.- an inclination to do somethingnoun.- a natural inclination SENTENCE: A propensity is a natural tendency to behave in a certain way. We all have propensities \u2014 things we tend to do. Dogs have a propensity to bark, and many people have a propensity for getting annoyed by it. MNEMONIC: If you have a propensity for something, then it's something that comes naturally to you or something you just do a lot. Some people have a propensity to laugh. Other people have a propensity for making others laugh, or for being generous, or for getting angry. It's hard to change your propensities. Sometimes a propensity is a bad thing, as in a criminal with a propensity for theft or murder.", "MEANING: noun.- an imperial decree that becomes part of the fundamental law of the landadjective.- guided by practical experience and observation rather than theoryadjective.- of or concerning the theory of pragmatismadjective.- concerned with practical matters SENTENCE: To describe a person or a solution that takes a realistic approach, consider the adjective pragmatic. The four-year-old who wants a unicorn for her birthday isn't being very pragmatic. MNEMONIC: The opposite of idealistic is pragmatic, a word that describes a philosophy of \"doing what works best.\" From Greek pragma \"deed,\" the word has historically described philosophers and politicians who were concerned more with real-world application of ideas than with abstract notions. A pragmatic person is sensible, grounded, and practical \u2014 and doesn't expect a birthday celebration filled with magical creatures.", "MEANING: verb.- make better or more attractiveverb.- increase SENTENCE: Many people use the expression \"enhance your chance\" to point out ways to increase your chances of winning or earning a contest or prize. When you enhance something, you heighten it or make it better. MNEMONIC: \"Hance\" is not a word, but the addition of \"en-\" does something to enhance it and improve its sound. You can enhance the size of something, too, by altering it or raising it, which is what the word original meant (the \"hance\" part came via French from Latin altus, meaning \"high\"). When you enhance something you take it to a higher level, like adding salt to French fries to enhance flavor or adding words to enhance your vocabulary.", "MEANING: adjective.- easily tricked because of being too trustingadjective.- naive and easily deceived or tricked SENTENCE: If you are gullible, the joke is on you because you are easily fooled. MNEMONIC: It is thought that gullible might be derived from the verb gull, meaning \"to swallow.\" This would be a funny coincidence as gullible describes an overly trusting person who tends to swallow the stories he hears whole. The related word, gull, can be used as a noun \"don't be such a gull!\" or as a verb \"you can't gull me into believing that!\"", "MEANING: noun.- righteousness by virtue of being pious SENTENCE: Piety is devotion to God or to religious practices. Nuns who pray all day long are famous for their piety. If you have filial piety it means you're devoted to your parents. MNEMONIC: Piety is sometimes used in a disapproving way to mean that the person is only pretending to be devoted or good.  Piety was borrowed from French piet\u00e9 \"piety, pity,\" from Latin pietas, from pius \"devoted, kind.\" This Latin adjective is the source of our English adjective pious.", "MEANING: noun.- a precipitated solid substance in suspension or after settling or filteringverb.- separate as a fine suspension of solid particlesverb.- fall from cloudsadjective.- done with very great haste and without due deliberationverb.- fall vertically, sharply, or headlongverb.- hurl or throw violentlyverb.- bring about abruptly SENTENCE: Precipitate usually means \"bringing something on\" or \"making it happen\" \u2014 and not always in a good way. An unpopular verdict might \"precipitate violence\" or one false step at the Grand Canyon could precipitate you down into the gorge. MNEMONIC: Precipitate, as a verb, can also mean specifically, \"to fall from clouds,\" such as rain, snow, or other forms of precipitation. When used as an adjective, precipitate means \"hasty\" or \"acting suddenly.\" If you decide to throw your class project in a trash masher just because someone in your class had a similar idea, then your actions might be described as precipitate. Or if you do that sort of thing regularly, you may be a precipitate person.", "MEANING: verb.- be deliberately ambiguous or unclear in order to mislead or withhold information SENTENCE: When you are unwilling to make a decision and almost intentionally go back and forth between two choices, you are equivocating. When politicians equivocate, they are often afraid of upsetting, and thus alienating, voters with their decisions. MNEMONIC: A key part of equivocate is the root vocate, which comes from the Latin vocare or \"voice.\" When you give your voice to two opposing views in order to mislead or keep your options open, you're equivocating. Think of the expression, to talk out of both sides of your mouth. If you want to go to a party and your parents keep saying \"maybe, it depends,\" tell them to stop equivocating and give you a straight answer.", "MEANING: noun.- something that causes an important event to happennoun.- (chemistry) a substance that initiates or accelerates a chemical reaction without itself being affected SENTENCE: A catalyst is an event or person causing a change. Getting kicked out of your parents' house might be a catalyst for becoming more independent. MNEMONIC: The noun catalyst is something or someone that causes a change and is derived from the Greek word katal\u03cdein, meaning \"to dissolve.\" It can be somewhat ordinary, like when moving to a warmer climate was the catalyst for getting a short, sporty haircut. Or it can be major, like how the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of the Austro-Hungarian Empire is said to be a catalyst of World War I.", "MEANING: noun.- (computer science) electronic equipment connected by cable to the CPU of a computeradjective.- related to the key issue but not of central importanceadjective.- on or near an edge or constituting an outer boundary; the outer area SENTENCE: Scanners, printers, and speakers are peripheral devices for a computer because they aren't central to the working of the computer itself. Anything peripheral is on the margin, or outside, while main things, like a computer's processor, are not peripheral. MNEMONIC: Outside of computer jargon, peripheral is a common term in eye exams, which measure peripheral vision to see how far toward the outer right and left edges you can see. Peripheral also describes nerves from the body's peripheral system, which are secondary to the main system but branch off of it \u2014 like the wires between peripheral devices and a computer.", "MEANING: noun.- prudence in avoiding waste SENTENCE: If you try to avoid waste by reusing and repurposing items that most people would throw away, your frugality will save you money. MNEMONIC: Some people use this word interchangeably with cheapness, but cheapness is an unwillingness to spend, while frugality is an unwillingness to waste. People who show frugality often find ways of making things useful that others do not. Even after the Depression ended, those who lived through it maintained their frugality, using old t-shirts for rags and washed-out cottage cheese containers instead of Tupperware.", "MEANING: adjective.- transformed from a liquid into a soft semisolid or solid massverb.- cause to change from a liquid to a solid or thickened stateverb.- change from a liquid to a thickened or solid state SENTENCE: When liquid starts to thicken and become solid, it coagulates. When you get a cut, the blood flowing from the wound will coagulate: it will start to clot and form a solid scab so you will stop bleeding. MNEMONIC: Many liquids have the potential to coagulate. If the cream you just poured into your coffee is spoiled, you'll see the cream coagulate as it curdles into little floating chunks. If someone has a heart condition that may result in a heart attack, he or she might take medication that keep the blood in the arteries from coagulating, or dangerously thickening.", "MEANING: noun.- excessive fervor to do something or accomplish some endnoun.- prompt willingnessnoun.- a feeling of strong eagerness (usually in favor of a person or cause) SENTENCE: Zeal is dedication or enthusiasm for something. If you have zeal, you're willing, energized, and motivated. MNEMONIC: Zeal is often used in a religious sense, meaning devotion to God or another religious cause, like being a missionary. Zeal doesn't have to be religious, though: a feeling of gusto and enthusiasm for anything can be called zeal. People have zeal for sports teams, bands, causes, and (often, but not always) their jobs. If you have passion for something, you have zeal, which is kind of a mix of eagerness and energy and devotion.", "MEANING: noun.- shallowness in terms of affecting only surface layers of somethingnoun.- lack of depth of knowledge or thought or feeling SENTENCE:  MNEMONIC: ", "MEANING: adjective.- characterized by assertion of unproved or unprovable principlesadjective.- relating to or involving dogmaadjective.- of or pertaining to or characteristic of a doctrine or code of beliefs accepted as authoritative SENTENCE: To be dogmatic is to follow a set of rules no matter what. The rules might be religious, philosophical, or made-up, but dogmatic people would never waver in their beliefs so don\u2019t even think of trying to change their minds. MNEMONIC: Dogmatic goes back to the Greek words dogma, which means basically \u201cwhat one thinks is true\u201d and dogmatikos, \u201cpertaining to doctrine.\u201d To be dogmatic is to follow a doctrine relating to morals and faith, a set of beliefs that is passed down and never questioned. It also refers to arrogant opinions based on unproven theories or even despite facts. Someone dogmatic might insist that dinosaurs never existed or that women shouldn\u2019t drive. Dogmatic people are usually not very popular.", "MEANING: adjective.- deficient in amount or quality or extentadjective.- unwilling to spend SENTENCE: If you are looking to describe someone with a Scrooge- or Grinch-like tendency to pinch his pennies, then stingy can be your adjective of choice. Or, if you are looking to describe something you have too little of \u2014 like a 43-second coffee break \u2014 you can use stingy as well. MNEMONIC: The adjective stingy (pronounced with a soft \"g\") is likely derived from the adjective stingy (pronounced with a hard \"g\"), which means \"biting, sharp, or stinging.\" Although stingy is usually used to describe an ungenerous or miserly person, stingy can also be used to describe a larger entity: \"People were no longer able to buy homes due to the stingy lending policies of the banks.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- lacking social polish SENTENCE: Use the word gauche when you want to call something tacky, graceless, tactless, rude, boorish, or awkward and foolish. Have you just pointed out someone's misuse of this word? Oh dear, how gauche! MNEMONIC: Gauche was used for a long time to refer to things that were just so wrong, it almost hurt to talk about them, like publicly asking someone why they don\u2019t like you. That is so gauche, it could induce a cringe! Gauche is almost a gauche word, as it is comes from a French word meaning left (as opposed to right). It would be gauche to call left-handed people tacky!", "MEANING: verb.- represent falselyverb.- be in contradiction with SENTENCE: To belie means to contradict. If you are 93 but look like you are 53, then your young looks belie your age. MNEMONIC: We get belie from the Old English beleogan, which meant \"to deceive by lying.\" It suggests characteristics or behavior that inadvertently or deliberately hide the truth. To remember it, just think \"be lying.\" Snow White's decision to barge into the Seven Dwarfs' home without invitation belied her gentle nature.", "MEANING: adjective.- as a formality onlyadjective.- hasty and without attention to detail; not thorough SENTENCE: Perfunctory means done as part of a routine or duty. If you give someone a gift and they look at it like it's roadkill and say nothing but a perfunctory \"thank you,\" you might not be giving them another one anytime soon. MNEMONIC: A person who does something in a perfunctory way shows little enthusiasm or interest in what they are doing. Many of our everyday greetings are perfunctory. For example, when we say \"Hello\" and \"How are you?\", we usually do so out of habit. Perfunctory is from Latin perfunctus, from perfungi, \"to get through with, perform,\" formed from the Latin prefix per-, \"completely,\" plus fungi, \"to perform.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- characterized by angeradjective.- quickly aroused to anger SENTENCE: If you're irascible, you get angry easily \u2014 perhaps blowing up in rage when someone brushes into you. MNEMONIC: Irascible comes from the Latin root ira, which means \"anger\" or \"rage,\" the same root that gives us  the word ire, \"anger.\" The -sc in the middle of irascible, means \"becoming,\" so irascible doesn't just mean you're angry \u2014 it's got action built into it. If you're looking for a fight most of the time, then you're irascible \u2014 ready for the spark that's going to set you on fire.", "MEANING: noun.- steadiness of mind under stress SENTENCE: If you take the news of your parakeet's death with equanimity, it means you take it calmly without breaking down. Equanimity refers to emotional calmness and balance in times of stress. MNEMONIC: If equanimity reminds you of equal, that's because the words have a lot in common. The noun equanimity was borrowed from Latin aequanimit\u0101s, from aequanimus \"even-tempered, fair,\" formed from aequus \"even, level, equal\" plus animus \"mind.\" The archaic phrase to bear with equal mind means \"to bear with a calm mind,\" and is a translation from the Latin. The phrase a level mind also refers to calmness. A near synonym is composure.", "MEANING: adjective.- deficient in alertness or activity SENTENCE: When you feel lethargic, you're sluggish or lacking energy. Being sleepy or hungry can make anyone lethargic. MNEMONIC: Being lethargic makes it hard to get anything done: you feel weak and sleepy. Whatever the reason, a lethargic person needs to snap out of it and get some energy, maybe by eating something or by taking a nap. Being lethargic also goes well with watching TV, since that takes almost no energy at all. When you feel lethargic, you don't have any energy to spare.", "MEANING: noun.- a concise but comprehensive summary of a larger worknoun.- a publication containing a variety of works SENTENCE: When you search an online encyclopedia, you are searching a compendium of information on just about everything. A compendium is a comprehensive collection of something. MNEMONIC: You can also use the word compendium to describe a collection of written works. If you gather all of the anecdotes your parents and grandparents have told you into a book, you'll have created a compendium of family stories. The plural of compendium is either compendiums or compendia.", "MEANING: noun.- a mournful poem; a lament for the dead SENTENCE: An elegy is a sad poem, usually written to praise and express sorrow for someone who is dead. Although a speech at a funeral is a eulogy, you might later compose an elegy to someone you have loved and lost to the grave. MNEMONIC: The purpose of this kind of poem is to express feelings rather than tell a story. Thomas Gray's \u201cElegy Written in a Country Churchyard\u201d is a poem that reflects on the lives of common people buried in a church cemetery, and on the nature of human mortality. The noun elegy was borrowed in the 16th century from Middle French \u00e9l\u00e9gie, from Latin eleg\u012ba, from Greek elegeia, from elegos \"mournful poem or song.\"", "MEANING: verb.- make imperfectverb.- make worse or less effective SENTENCE: If you make bad decisions in the morning after drinking coffee, you might conclude that caffeine tends to impair your judgment. When you impair something, you damage it or make it work poorly. MNEMONIC: The root of the verb impair traces back to the Latin word pejorare, meaning \u201cto make worse,\u201d and that\u2019s still what happens if you impair something. Whether it\u2019s communication, visibility, or your marriage prospects, if you impair it, you make it worse. The word can be used for situations that describe something that has deteriorated, such as \u201cSnow continued to impair driving conditions.\u201d", "MEANING: noun.- (botany) a plant lasting for three seasons or moreadjective.- lasting three seasons or moreadjective.- recurring again and againadjective.- lasting an indefinitely long time; suggesting self-renewal SENTENCE: Perennial typically describes things that are permanent, constant, or repeated. If you fight with your parents every year over whether they really must invite your annoying cousins for Thanksgiving, you could call that a perennial conflict. MNEMONIC: Arguing with your roommate about who cleaned the bathroom last time might be a perennial argument. There is also a perennial plant, which lasts more than two years and usually reappears each spring, because it produces flowers and seeds from the same root structure. Perennial comes from the Latin perennis, from the prefix per-, \"through,\" plus annus, or \"year.\" Annus is also the source of our English word annual \u2014 an annual plant lives only one year or season.", "MEANING: noun.- an evasion of the point of an argument by raising irrelevant distinctions or objectionsverb.- argue over petty thingsverb.- evade the truth of a point or question by raising irrelevant objections SENTENCE: A quibble is a small argument or fight. As a verb, it means to pick a mini-fight over something that doesn't really matter. \"Let's not quibble over price,\" people will say, usually when they plan to gouge you. MNEMONIC: It's better to watch figure skating with the sound off, rather than listening to the announcers quibble over a not-fully-rotated knee or the slightly diminished altitude of a jump. Sometimes a quibble between neighbors over two feet of property can escalate into a major feud.", "MEANING: adjective.- easily influencedadjective.- capable of being shaped or bent or drawn out SENTENCE: A malleable metal is able to be pounded or pressed into various shapes, and a malleable personality is capable of being changed or trained. It's easier to learn when you're young and malleable. MNEMONIC: Just as there are substances that are malleable, including clay and some metals, there are also ductile metals that can be hammered out into wire or thread; gold, silver, and platinum are examples. The adjective malleable dates back to Middle English, from Old French, from Medieval Latin malle\u0101bilis, from malle\u0101re, \"to hammer.\"", "MEANING: verb.- describe in vivid detailverb.- determine the essential quality ofverb.- make a mark or lines on a surfaceverb.- trace the shape ofverb.- show the form or outline ofadjective.- represented accurately or precisely SENTENCE: Though you pronounce it duh-LIN-ee-ate, there is a \"line\" in the middle of delineate. This might help you remember that to delineate is to outline and define something in detail or with an actual marking of lines and boundaries. MNEMONIC: When you create an outline for a paper it usually summarizes what you will detail later. You delineate the sections, or mark the heading lines, and when you write the details, you delineate the subject of each heading. So, to delineate is both to mark lines and to fill in the lines. Using a fence to divide properties or a carpet to claim your side of the bedroom also is a way to delineate, or mark, physical boundaries.", "MEANING: verb.- hide under a false appearanceverb.- make believe with the intent to deceiveverb.- behave unnaturally or affectedly SENTENCE: To dissemble is to hide under a false appearance, to deceive. \"When confronted about their human rights record, the Chinese government typically dissembles.\" MNEMONIC: Dissemble is a little more complicated than a straight lie or denial. When you dissemble, you disguise your true intentions or feelings behind a false appearance. To dissemble is to pretend that you don't know something, to pretend that you think one way when you act another way. \"My boyfriend was dissembling the whole time. He was a married father of two.\"", "MEANING: noun.- the tendency to be untruthful SENTENCE: Mendacity is a tendency to lie. Your friend might swear that he didn't eat your secret chocolate stash, but you'll find it hard to believe him if he's known for his mendacity. MNEMONIC: Anyone in the habit of lying frequently has the characteristic of mendacity. People often accuse government officials of mendacity, or being less than honest. You're bound to get frustrated by the mendacity of your friend who's a pathological liar. Mendacity comes from the Latin root word mendacium, or \"lie.\" Don't confuse mendacity with a similar-sounding word, audacity \u2014 which means \"fearlessness, daring, or bravery.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- mixed with impuritiesverb.- corrupt, debase, or make impure by adding a foreign or inferior substance; often by replacing valuable ingredients with inferior ones SENTENCE: If you adulterate something, you mess it up. You may not want to adulterate the beauty of freshly fallen snow by shoveling it, but how else are you going to get to work? MNEMONIC: The verb adulterate comes from the Latin word adulterare, which means \u201cto falsify,\u201d or \u201cto corrupt.\u201d Whenever something original, pure, fresh, or wholesome is marred, polluted, defaced, or otherwise made inferior, it has been adulterated. Your grandfather may, for instance, believe that bartenders adulterate the name \u201cMartini\u201d by applying it to combinations of vodka, chocolate or anything other than a mixture of five parts gin to one part dry vermouth, on the rocks, with a twist.", "MEANING: verb.- make turbid by stirring up the sediments ofverb.- cause annoyance in; disturb, especially by minor irritations SENTENCE: To rile someone is to annoy or bother them. For example, a friend might rile you by constantly texting when you're trying to have a conversation with her. You can also rile water, meaning you make it muddy by stirring it up. MNEMONIC: The verb rile is derived from roil, and they basically mean the same thing. However, rile is more commonly used to mean \"annoy\" and roil mostly describes stirred liquid. If you rile up your sister, what you say makes gets her worked up, ready to argue with you. When a kid splashes around in the tub, the water is roiled \u2014 but if it gets all over the floor, his parents will be riled.", "MEANING: adjective.- supplied (especially fed) to satisfactionverb.- overeat or eat immodestly; make a pig of oneselfverb.- fill to satisfaction SENTENCE: If you just can't get enough popcorn, even the jumbo tub at the movie theater may not be enough to satiate, or satisfy, your desire. MNEMONIC: Satiate is often used in situations in which a thirst, craving, or need is satisfied. However, when satiate is used to describe eating, it can take on a more negative, or even disgusted, tone. If you comment that the diners at the world's largest all-you-can eat buffet were satiated, you might not mean that they were merely satisfied. You could be implying that they've been gluttons, and that they are now overstuffed with fried chicken wings and mac and cheese.", "MEANING: adjective.- being born or beginning SENTENCE: The adjective nascent describes the birth or beginning of something, like a civilization, a trend, an idea, or an action. If your idea for a time machine is nascent, it needs a lot more work before you'll be ready to travel to ancient Egypt. MNEMONIC: Imagine you\u2019re in the future looking back at the first time you learned the definition of the word nascent. Your nascent efforts to use the word felt awkward, but you quickly felt comfortable with it, especially after you learned how to pronounce it: \u201cNAY-sent.\u201d  Now you use the word all the time!", "MEANING: noun.- a large kingfisher widely distributed in warmer parts of the Old Worldnoun.- (Greek mythology) a woman who was turned into a kingfisher SENTENCE:  MNEMONIC: ", "MEANING: verb.- impose a penalty on; inflict punishment onnoun.- the act of punishingnoun.- a mechanism of social control for enforcing a society's standardsverb.- give religious sanction to, such as through on oathverb.- give sanction toverb.- give authority or permission tonoun.- the act of final authorizationnoun.- formal and explicit approvalnoun.- official permission or approval SENTENCE: Sanction has two nearly opposite meanings: to sanction can be to approve of something, but it can also mean to punish, or speak harshly to. Likewise, a sanction can be a punishment or approval. Very confusing \u2014 the person who invented this word should be publicly sanctioned! MNEMONIC: See if you can guess the meaning of sanction in the following contexts. Before invading Iraq, the U.S. and its allies first imposed sanctions on the country, refusing to supply the country with much-needed trade items. Did you guess that sanction = \"punishment\"? You were right! But by trading with China at the same time, the U.S. quietly sanctioned that nation's known instances of human rights abuses. Did you guess that sanction = \"approval\"? You're right again!", "MEANING: verb.- cast offverb.- reject as untrue, unfounded, or unjustverb.- refuse to recognize or payverb.- refuse to acknowledge, ratify, or recognize as valid SENTENCE: To repudiate something is to reject it, or to refuse to accept or support it. If you grow up religious, but repudiate all organized religion as an adult, you might start spending holidays at the movies, or just going to work. MNEMONIC: This verb usually refers to rejecting something that has authority, such as a legal contract, doctrine, or claim. In connection with debts or other obligations, repudiate is used in the specialized sense \"to refuse to recognize or pay.\" If referring to a child or a lover, repudiate is used in the sense \"to disown, cast off.\" This verb is derived from Latin repudiare \"to put away, divorce.\"", "MEANING: noun.- the deliberate act of delaying and playing instead of workingadjective.- not worth considering SENTENCE: If something is trifling it's really unimportant, of no consequence \u2014 \"a trifling detail.\" MNEMONIC: Everything is relative, of course, and what might appear trifling to one person may take on deep importance for another. Clues are classically trifling things. As Sherlock Holmes explains to Dr. Watson when faced with a seemingly minor detail: \"It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles.\"", "MEANING: noun.- a cold pudding made of layers of sponge cake spread with fruit or jelly; may be decorated with nuts, cream, or chocolateverb.- waste time; spend one's time idly or inefficientlyverb.- act frivolouslyverb.- consider not very seriouslynoun.- something of small importancenoun.- a detail that is considered insignificant SENTENCE: A trifle is something that's totally unimportant. If your friend is freaking out over which poster to buy and you call her dilemma a trifle, you're saying she shouldn't get so worked up over nothing. MNEMONIC: Trifle comes from the Middle English trufle, meaning \"fraud, joke, trick.\" You'll usually hear it used to mean \"insignificant, trivial.\" If you write a little ditty to sing at a birthday party, you could say it's just a trifle. As a verb, trifle means \"toy with, waste.\" If you play with someone's feelings without seriously meaning anything, you are trifling with his affection. Trifle is also a sweet, sticky cake. Don't trifle the day away dreaming about trifle. Make some!", "MEANING: verb.- prevent the occurrence of; prevent from happeningverb.- do away with SENTENCE: To obviate means to eliminate the need for something or to prevent something from happening. If you want to obviate the possibility of a roach infestation, clean your kitchen regularly. MNEMONIC: The prefix ob means \"to go against.\"  That makes sense when you look at the words obstruct and obstacle, but how about obstetrics? Why does the name of the branch of medicine dealing with birth have the same root as words that mean \"stop\" or \"get in the way\"? Because a midwife stands opposite to, or against, the woman giving birth.", "MEANING: noun.- official recognition or approvalnoun.- official approval SENTENCE: Approbation is a formal word for approval or praise. Approbation is like getting the nod in a big way. Politicians rely on the public\u2019s approbation to get elected. MNEMONIC: How is it possible that approbation means approval when probation is a form of being in trouble? Probation is a testing period, to see if you can be good. Approbation means it's all good. Or you can remember this rhyme: \"Filled with approbation, the audience gave a standing ovation.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- (used of conduct or character) deserving or bringing disgrace or shame SENTENCE: Losing a football game stinks, but losing a game where, at the end, you are lying face down in a puddle of mud and the fans are burning effigies of you in the streets? That is an ignominious defeat. MNEMONIC: Although ignominious can modify other words, it is nearly always attached to \"defeat.\" It derives from the word ignominy, which means public shame or defeat. Ignominy derives from the Latin in- \"not\" + a variant of nomen \"name.\"", "MEANING: verb.- maintain, uphold, or defendverb.- clear of accusation, blame, suspicion, or doubt with supporting proofverb.- show to be right by providing justification or proof SENTENCE: Vindicate means to justify, prove, or reinforce an idea \u2014 or to absolve from guilt. If your family thinks you hogged the last piece of pie on Thanksgiving, you'll be vindicated when your younger brother fesses up. MNEMONIC: Vindicate derives from the Latin vindicatus, which is the past tense of vindicare, meaning \"lay claim to\" or \"avenge.\" When a physicist proves a theory that his colleagues derided, he vindicates it. When a lawyer clears her client's name in a trial, she vindicates him. Machiavelli argued that the results he got vindicated his tactics \u2014 in other words, the ends justified the means.", "MEANING: noun.- (philosophy) a philosophical theory as to what is beautifuladjective.- relating to or dealing with the subject of aestheticsadjective.- aesthetically pleasingadjective.- concerning or characterized by an appreciation of beauty or good taste SENTENCE: The adjective aesthetic comes in handy when the subject at hand is beauty or the arts. A velvet painting of dogs playing poker might have minimal aesthetic appeal. MNEMONIC: Aesthetic, from a Greek word meaning \"perception,\" comes to us from German philosophers who used it for a theory of the beautiful. From this technical sense, it soon came to refer to good taste and to artistry in general; if something has \"aesthetic value,\" it has value as a work of art (even if nobody will pay much for it). It does not, however, refer to the objects themselves; do not talk about an \"aesthetic painting.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- uncertain or unable to decide about what course to follow SENTENCE: If you can't decide how you feel about something, declare yourself ambivalent about it. MNEMONIC: Ambivalent means \"having mixed feelings about something.\" A Swiss psychologist named Eugen Bleuler coined the German word Ambivalenz in the early twentieth century, and it was soon imported into English. Bleuler combined the Latin prefix ambi-, meaning \"both,\" with valentia, \"strength.\" So etymologically speaking, if you're ambivalent you're being pulled by two equally strong things \u2014 but in practice, ambivalence often arises from caring very little either way. You might feel ambivalent about your lunch options if you have to choose between a murky stew and flavorless tofu.", "MEANING: noun.- the weaker part of a sword's blade from the forte to the tipnoun.- a minor weakness or peculiarity in someone's character SENTENCE: If you repeat foible out loud enough times, it sounds so funny that you can laugh at it and maybe remember to laugh at the odd and distinctive weaknesses of others \u2014 the foible or two or a hundred that we all have. MNEMONIC: Sometimes a foible helps make a person who they are, even if the foible, or weakness (\"feeble\" is a close relative), is a little odd. Synonyms for foible in a negative sense are \"failing,\" \"shortcoming,\" and in a more positive sense \"quirk,\" \"eccentricity.\" It can likewise be annoying or endearing. Most people have a foible, or idiosyncrasy, that stands out to others, but interestingly, a person rarely sees his or her own characteristic foible.", "MEANING: noun.- the process of going into solutionnoun.- dissolute indulgence in sensual pleasurenoun.- the termination of a meetingnoun.- the termination or disintegration of a relationship (between persons or nations)noun.- separation into component parts SENTENCE: The dissolution of a relationship means that it's broken up or ended. The dissolution of your band means you better get started on your solo album. MNEMONIC: Dissolution comes from the Latin word dissolutio, meaning \"a dissolving of something.\" Dissolution looks very similar to \"dissolve,\" so to help you remember the meaning, think about what happens if you put paper in water \u2014 it breaks apart. A dissolution of a marriage is the same thing as divorce. Although it sounds like disillusion, if you try to use them interchangeably, your logic will fall apart.", "MEANING: TraditionalSENTENCE: Orthodox practices or beliefs are generally accepted as true or correct. If you are an orthodox vegetarian, you never, ever eat meat \u2014 not like those people who have fish once in a while.MNEMONIC: When capitalized, Orthodox is the name of the Eastern Church, originally distinguished by its doctrinal differences from the other divisions of the Christian Church. Orthodox is also the name of the branch of Judaism that strictly follows traditional beliefs and customs, derived from orthodox in the earlier meaning of \"strictly observant.\"", "MEANING: noun.- a volatile substance; a substance that changes readily from solid or liquid to a vaporadjective.- evaporating readily at normal temperatures and pressuresadjective.- tending to vary often or widelyadjective.- marked by erratic changeableness in affections or attachmentsadjective.- liable to lead to sudden change or violence SENTENCE: Watch out when a situation becomes volatile \u2014 it is likely to change for the worse suddenly. If you and your best friend have a volatile relationship, you frequently fight and make up. MNEMONIC: Volatile from Latin volatilis, \"fleeting, transitory,\" always gives the sense of sudden, radical change. Think of it as the opposite of stable. A person who is volatile loses his or her temper suddenly and violently. A volatile political situation could erupt into civil war. When the stock market is volatile, it fluctuates greatly.  And in scientific language, a volatile oil evaporates quickly.", "MEANING: adjective.- changeableadjective.- determined by chance or impulse or whim rather than by necessity or reason SENTENCE: Capricious is an adjective to describe a person or thing that's impulsive and unpredictable, like a bride who suddenly leaves her groom standing at the wedding altar. MNEMONIC: You can criticize a fickle-minded person as capricious, but it could just as well describe quickly changing weather, as in \"capricious spring storms.\" It's the adjective form of the noun caprice, which means a sudden change of mood. Caprice might come from capra, the Italian word for \"goat\" (because goats are frisky), or from capo, \"head\" + riccio, \"hedgehog.\" Why bring hedgehogs into it? If you have a \"hedgehog head,\" you are so scared that your hair is standing straight on end. A scared person makes sudden starts this way and that, just as a capricious person does.", "MEANING: verb.- take exception to SENTENCE: Gainsay, a verb, means \"contradict\" or \"speak out against.\" When you challenge authority, you gainsay, as in teachers don't like it when unruly students gainsay them. MNEMONIC: Gainsay comes from an Old English word that means \"contradict\" or \"say against,\" as in, no one dared gainsay the principal, who is well-known for giving detention to students who so much as frown at him. If you know someone who constantly corrects others, tells them that they're wrong, and says, \"That's not true,\" more than anyone else, you have first-hand experience with the art of the gainsay.", "MEANING: adjective.- impervious to correction by punishment SENTENCE: Someone incorrigible seems to be beyond correcting, improving, or changing. When you talk about an incorrigible bully, you're saying they're always going to push other people around. MNEMONIC: Even though incorrigible implies a person is kind of hopeless, it's often used as a light-hearted word. When we describe someone as an incorrigible flirt or as an incorrigible gossip, we mean that this is just the way they are, and it would be foolish to try and change them. If someone is just being obnoxious as usual, you could say \"You're incorrigible!\"", "MEANING: noun.- extravagant exaggeration SENTENCE: Praising your favorite sports team is one thing, but if you call the team the most incredible group of humans ever to walk the earth, then you're going overboard and indulging in hyperbole. MNEMONIC: The hyper- in hyperbole means \"beyond,\" so it's a good sign that the word has to do with going above and beyond what's necessary. Someone who gets hyperactive about something and ends up hyperventilating (breathing too hard) might be prone to the exaggerated style of speaking known as hyperbole. If you find yourself talking about the absolutely best (or worst) thing of all time, it's time to take it down a notch and cut down on the hyperbole.", "MEANING: adjective.- independent in behavior or thoughtnoun.- an unbranded range animal (especially a stray calf); belongs to the first person who puts a brand on itnoun.- someone who exhibits great independence in thought and action SENTENCE: A maverick is a rebel, someone who shows a lot of independence. A maverick on a motorcycle might blaze her own trail, traveling around the country and earning money by performing in rodeos. MNEMONIC: Samuel A. Maverick owned a lot of cattle, and he let them roam around Texas without a brand, or identification mark, seared into their skins. Samuel was a maverick for going against the common practice of tracking his animals, and his last name became part of the English language as both an adjective and a noun in the 19th century. Someone who acts very independently is a maverick, and individual actions that stand out are maverick, as in \"her maverick jumping style on the ice was both wild and delicate.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- showing a cheerful willingness to do favors for others SENTENCE: If only the world were populated entirely with complaisant people! Complaisant means willing to do something to please others, and complaisant people or animals are wonderful to be around. MNEMONIC: Don't confuse complaisant with its near-homonym complacent. Both derive from the Latin complacere \"to please,\" but while complaisant means willing to do something to please another, complacent means smug and self-satisfied, something that you want to avoid when you're on the winning team.", "MEANING: verb.- take the place or move into the position of SENTENCE: If you click on the link after this description, a new screen will supersede, or replace, this one. A longer description will supplant, or supersede, by replacing this brief one. MNEMONIC: Most words that include super have something good going on. Supersede is from the 16th-century Latin for \"sit on top,\" and it often means to replace with something better. A version 10 of a computer game will supersede, version 9, making it more exciting. Unfortunately, a person might be replaced too, as in \"the younger running back will supersede the veteran player as he gets older.\" To supersede is generally a good thing, but being superseded is not always that great for the replaced person.", "MEANING: adjective.- reduced in strengthverb.- weaken the consistency of (a chemical substance)verb.- become weaker, in strength, value, or magnitude SENTENCE: Attenuate is a verb that means to make or become weaker. The effects of aging may be attenuated by exercise \u2014 or by drinking from the fountain of youth. MNEMONIC: The versatile word attenuate denotes a weakening in amount, intensity, or value. As a verb, attenuate is usually transitive, meaning it needs an object to be complete, such as in the sentence: \"This tanning process tends to attenuate the deer hide, making it softer.\" The word can be intransitive in past tense, as in \"The rain attenuated, ending the storm.\"  And it can even be used as an adjective to describe something weakened: \"Even an attenuated solution will remove the stain.\"", "MEANING: verb.- censure severelyverb.- inflict severe punishment on SENTENCE: Use castigate  when you mean \"to reprimand in an especially harsh way.\" If you accidentally spill coffee all over your sister's favorite sweater, you might worry that she's going to castigate you as soon as she finds out. MNEMONIC: Castigate means punish, and punish harshly, but the punishment is always a severe scolding. Sometimes it means criticize severely. Politicians in the Senate are always castigating each other for their alliances and opinions. Castigate and chasten, which also means \"to reprimand\" but is less severe, share the Latin root castus which means \"pure.\" Ideally, if you castigate someone, you mean to guide someone away from the wrong path and toward a more pure one. But it sure doesn't feel like that when you're being castigated!", "MEANING: noun.- the metal bob of a plumb lineverb.- drop sharply SENTENCE: The verb plummet means \"to drop sharply,\" like eagles that plummet toward earth, seeking prey, or school attendance that plummets when there is a flu outbreak. MNEMONIC: To correctly pronounce plummet, say \"PLUH-met.\" This verb describes something that drops sharply or quickly, like a roller coaster that plummets down a hill, temperatures that plummet overnight, or sales of roses and candy that plummet after Valentine's Day. If something plummets, this doesn't mean it will stay down or low forever, just that it has experienced a sharp drop.", "MEANING: verb.- grow and flourish SENTENCE: Use the verb burgeon to describe something that is growing, expanding, and flourishing. If you have a green thumb, in the spring your flower gardens may burgeon. If you don't have a green thumb, your collection of plastic plants may burgeon. MNEMONIC: Although burgeon means to grow and flourish, it doesn't necessarily have to apply only to plants. Your town can have burgeoning downtown development. Your tiny retirement account can burgeon into an excellent emergency fund if you invest even a small amount each month. You may have a burgeoning career as a villain if you overthrow a planet by using your mind-controlling ray gun on the populace.", "MEANING: verb.- add details to SENTENCE: If you are a window washer, but you refer to yourself as a \"vista enhancement specialist,\" then you are aggrandizing your job title \u2014 that is, making it sound greater than it is. MNEMONIC: The verb aggrandize not only means \"to make appear greater\"; it can also be used to mean simply \"to make greater.\" If you buy an estate and sink millions of dollars into its improvement, then you are actually aggrandizing the estate. If you are making yourself seem greater, then people may say you are \"self-aggrandizing.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- lacking substance or significanceadjective.- having thin consistencyadjective.- very thin in gauge or diameter SENTENCE: If something is tenuous it's thin, either literally or metaphorically. If you try to learn a complicated mathematical concept by cramming for 45 minutes, you will have a tenuous grasp of that concept, at best. MNEMONIC: Tenuous comes from the Latin word tenuis, for thin, and is related to our word tender. Something can be physically tenuous, like a spiderweb or ice on a pond. We more often use it in a metaphorical sense, to talk about weak ideas. Tenuous arguments won't win any debate tournaments. Synonyms for tenuous, also used physically or metaphorically, are flimsy and shaky.", "MEANING: adjective.- destructive of images used in religious worship; said of religions, such as Islam, in which the representation of living things is prohibitedadjective.- characterized by attack on established beliefs or institutions SENTENCE: The word iconoclastic is an adjective referring to a breaking of established rules or destruction of accepted beliefs. It might refer to an artist with an unorthodox style, or an iconoclastic attack, either physical or verbal, on a religious doctrine or image. MNEMONIC: Consider the Greek word eik\u014dn, or \"image,\" coupled with -klast\u0113s, \"one who breaks,\" and you get a good image of someone who is iconoclastic. An iconoclastic approach to religion involves tearing down the icons representing the church. While this was once done physically, through riots and mayhem, today\u2019s iconoclasts usually prefer using words. Not all iconoclasts are destructive, however. An iconoclastic approach to art and music has given rise to the development of new genres and styles through breaking the rules.", "MEANING: adjective.- lacking luster or shineadjective.- lacking brilliance or vitality SENTENCE: Lackluster is a compound adjective that means what it sounds like: if something is lackluster it lacks luster; in other words, it is without brilliance, shine, or vitality. Think dull. MNEMONIC: Shakespeare gave us the compound lackluster, first using the term in his play As You Like It. In 2:7, the character Jacques says, \"And then he drew a dial from his poke, And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye...\" Since Shakespeare first coined this word, it has been used to describe anything \"blah\"; lackluster sales would worry shop owners and a lackluster prom dress might help you blend in with the wallpaper.", "MEANING: verb.- derive or receive pleasure from; get enjoyment from; take pleasure inverb.- taste appreciativelyverb.- give taste toverb.- have flavor; taste of somethingnoun.- the taste experience when a savoury condiment is taken into the mouth SENTENCE: Whether it\u2019s a feeling of joy or a piece of pecan pie \u2014 when you savor something, you enjoy it to the fullest. MNEMONIC: When you savor something, you enjoy it so much that you want to make it last forever. With that in mind, savor carries a connotation of doing something slowly. If you savor that flourless chocolate tart, then you eat it slowly, bit by bit, deliberately picking every last crumb off the plate. The word is often applied to eating, but you can savor any pleasurable experience, whether it\u2019s the winning touchdown or your moment in the spotlight.", "MEANING: noun.- a branch that flows into the main streamnoun.- an affluent person; a person who is financially well offadjective.- having an abundant supply of money or possessions of value SENTENCE: You know you're driving through an affluent neighborhood when you see large houses, perfect landscaping, and expensive cars. Use affluent to describe wealthy people or areas. MNEMONIC: In Middle English, affluent meant \"abundant, flowing,\" from Old French, from Latin afflu\u0113ns, from affluere \"to abound in,\" from the prefix ad- \"to, at\" plus fluere \"to flow.\" The meaning of \"abundant, flowing\" is still seen in phrases such as \"affluent prose.\" But mostly, when you use the word affluent, the thing understood to be flowing is cash.", "MEANING: verb.- derive by reasonverb.- deduce (a principle) or construe (a meaning)verb.- call forth (emotions, feelings, and responses) SENTENCE: When you elicit, you're bringing out a response of some sort. A good comedian elicits a lot of laughs. MNEMONIC: Elicit has to do with creating or provoking a response. A great speech will elicit cheers \u2014 a bad speech will elicit boos. Teachers try to elicit responses from students. If a friend smiles at you, it will probably elicit a smile of your own. In court, a lawyer might try to elicit mistakes and inconsistencies in the testimony of a witness. In all cases, whatever is elicited is some kind of response.", "MEANING: adjective.- not easily perturbed or excited or upset; marked by extreme calm and composure SENTENCE: If you're imperturbable you are not easily upset. If your goal is to be imperturbable, then you can't let things bother you or get you stressed, confused, or angry. MNEMONIC: The adjective imperturbable is the flip side of perturbable, which comes from perturb, which in turn traces back to the Latin word perturbare, meaning \u201cto confuse\u201d or \u201cto disturb.\u201d If something really annoying is going on, like one neighbor is jack-hammering his driveway and another has a dog that's barking while you're trying to sleep because you were up all night studying and you really really need a nap, but you stay calm and don\u2019t get upset, you are imperturbable.", "MEANING: noun.- activity indicative of belief in the superiority of men over womennoun.- fanatical patriotism SENTENCE: Chauvinism means the belief that your country is superior to all others. If you traveled to China and complained about everything that was unfamiliar and talked about how much better things are back home, you'd be guilty of chauvinism. MNEMONIC: While the main meaning of chauvinism is an exaggerated sense of patriotism, or being convinced that your country is vastly better than any other, the word is most familiar in the sense of male chauvinism. When it's used this way, it means a belief that men are better than women. The word comes from a Napoleonic soldier, Nicholas Chauvin, who was famous for his extreme patriotism \u2014 in other words, his chauvinism.", "MEANING: noun.- extreme excess SENTENCE: Plethora means an abundance or excess of something. If you have 15 different people who want to take you on a date, you have a plethora of romantic possibilities. MNEMONIC: Plethora comes from the Greek for \"fullness.\" Although it was originally used only in old-fashioned medicine to describe the condition of having too much blood, we use it to talk about any excessive supply.  If you run a theater and all the seats are taken, that's a full house. But if the seats are full and people are standing in the aisles, you have a plethora of patrons. The stress is on the first syllable: PLETH-uh-ruh.", "MEANING: adjective.- tending to deternoun.- something immaterial that interferes with or delays action or progress SENTENCE: A deterrent makes you not want to do something. Let's say there's a giant pile of cookies being guarded by an angry dog \u2014 the dog is a deterrent. MNEMONIC: People talk about deterrents most often when discussing crime. The death penalty is supposed to be a deterrent \u2014 the idea is that people will be so scared of the death penalty that they won't commit certain crimes. Jail is another deterrent. Teachers also use deterrents \u2014 the possibility of getting detention is a deterrent that should encourage students to behave. A deterrent is the opposite of a reward. A reward encourages you to do the right thing, while a deterrent discourages you from doing the wrong thing.", "MEANING: noun.- the state of being emotionally aroused and worked upnoun.- feelings of great warmth and intensity SENTENCE: Use fervor to describe an intensity of emotion or expression. Fans of the Los Angeles Dodgers show so much fervor that they \"bleed Dodger blue.\" MNEMONIC: This noun comes to us from Latin fervere, meaning \"to boil, glow.\" In the English word fervor, the suffix \u2013or means \"a condition or property of something.\" There is another \u2013or suffix that means \"a person or thing that does the thing expressed by the verb.\" A corresponding adjective is fervent; synonyms of the noun and adjective are ardor and ardent.", "MEANING: adjective.- impossible to satisfy SENTENCE: If someone can't be satisfied, she is insatiable. After being lost in the woods eating only berries for a few days, you'll find your hunger is insatiable once you finally get to the table. MNEMONIC: Insatiable comes from the combination of the negative prefix, in- and the Latin verb satiare, for fill. Someone who is insatiable can never be full.  It can be used for spiritual as well as physical desires. Swift's traveling Gulliver talks about his \"insatiable desire of seeing foreign countries.\" Perhaps you have an insatiable desire to learn all the words in the English language. Synonyms are unappeasable and gluttonous.", "MEANING: noun.- a subtle difference in meaning or opinion or attitude SENTENCE: Use nuance to refer to a very small difference in color, meaning, or feeling. What makes singers brilliant is not how loud they can sing a note, but how many nuances they can evoke through their approach. MNEMONIC: Pronounced \"NOO-ahns,\" this noun was borrowed from French in the 18th century and derives ultimately from Latin n\u016bb\u0113s \"a cloud.\" Think of clouds\u2013\u2013subtle gradations in color to understand this word. When you say a work of art was nuanced, it means there was a lot to it, but incorporated subtly.", "MEANING: verb.- fail to pay upnoun.- act of failing to meet a financial obligationnoun.- loss resulting from failure of a debt to be paidnoun.- loss due to not showing upnoun.- an option that is selected automatically unless an alternative is specified SENTENCE: As a setting, a default is automatic.  You weren't sure why your new TV kept returning to the factory defaults until you realized you were sitting on the remote. MNEMONIC: Default can also refer to a lack of other options. You shop at Green's by default; it's the only grocery store in town.  Default is also a failure to pay a financial obligation. The number of loan defaults was down this month. As a verb, it means \"to fail to pay.\" Your credit score will go down if you default on a loan.", "MEANING: adjective.- having a capacity for continuing to grow at the apexadjective.- not leading to a definite ending or resultadjective.- of uncertain or ambiguous natureadjective.- not capable of being determinedadjective.- not precisely determined or established; not fixed or known in advance SENTENCE: Indeterminate means not known or decided. When someone contracts a rare stomach parasite but has not been traveling internationally, you might say it had indeterminate origins. MNEMONIC: It's important to distinguish indeterminate from undetermined, which means not yet decided. When you buy an antique vase and don't know when it dates from, you might describe it as of an indeterminate era. If you are traveling and don't know when you plan to return home, you could say that your return is as yet undetermined.", "MEANING: noun.- a hypothesis that is taken for grantednoun.- a message expressing an opinion based on incomplete evidencenoun.- the cognitive process of supposing SENTENCE: A supposition is a guess or a hypothesis. Your supposition that your kids will automatically wash their hands before dinner is probably false. You'd best remind them to do it or risk dirty hands at dinner. MNEMONIC: What's the difference between an assumption and a supposition \u2014 both nouns that are often taken as synonyms for each other? An assumption is an idea or theory that is usually made without proof. A supposition, on the other hand, has the connotation that the idea or theory is testable and provable. If you are to meet someone named Hunter, you may make the assumption that you are meeting a man. But if you know that Hunter lives in an all-female dorm, you may have the supposition that Hunter is a woman.", "MEANING: adjective.- not admitting of passage or capable of being affected SENTENCE: An impervious surface is one that can't be penetrated. The word is often followed by \"to,\" as in \"His steely personality made him impervious to jokes about his awful haircut.\" MNEMONIC: Most of the sentences you'll run across using impervious will be followed by the word \"to\" and a noun. Things are often described as being impervious to physical assaults like heat, water, bullets, weather, and attack, but just as frequently to less tangible things, like reason, criticism, pain, and pressure. The word comes from Latin: in- + pervius, meaning \"not letting things through.\" A common synonym is impermeable.", "MEANING: adjective.- openly distrustful and unwilling to confideadjective.- marked by keen caution and watchful prudence SENTENCE: Describe yourself as wary if you don't quite trust someone or something and want to proceed with caution. Be wary of risky things like wild mushrooms and Internet deals! MNEMONIC: You can trace wary through Old English back to Old High German giwar \"aware, attentive.\" If you keep a wary eye on something, you are attentive for signs that it is becoming dangerous. Likewise, if you give someone a wary glance, your face conveys the suspicion and caution you feel. When you are wary of driving alone at night or making promises, you fear something bad might happen if you do these things.", "MEANING: verb.- unite by forming a joint or jointsverb.- provide with a jointadjective.- consisting of segments held together by jointsadjective.- expressing yourself easily or characterized by clear expressive languageverb.- put into words or an expressionverb.- speak, pronounce, or utter in a certain wayverb.- express or state clearly SENTENCE: To articulate is to say something. And, if you say it well, someone might praise you by saying you are articulate. Confused yet? It's all in the pronunciation. MNEMONIC: Reach for articulate when you need an adjective meaning \"well-spoken\" (pronounced ar-TIC-yuh-lit) or a verb (ar-TIC-yuh-late) meaning \"to speak or express yourself clearly.\" The key to understanding articulate's many uses is to think of the related noun article: an articulate person clearly pronounces each article of his or her speech (that is, each word and syllable), and an articulated joint is divided up into distinct articles, or parts.", "MEANING: verb.- sink down or precipitateverb.- descend into or as if into some soft substance or placeverb.- sink to a lower level or form a depressionverb.- wear off or die down SENTENCE: To subside is to die down or become less violent, like rough ocean waves after a storm has passed (or your seasickness, if you happened to be sailing on that ocean). MNEMONIC: Subside comes from the Latin prefix sub- (meaning \"down\") and the Latin verb sidere (meaning \"to settle\"). Subside is often used when a negative situation has improved significantly. For example, violence, disease, and unemployment can all subside. Here's hoping that they do.", "MEANING: noun.- the trait of great self-denial (especially refraining from worldly pleasures) SENTENCE: If you've ever had a teacher who was particularly stern and strict, you might have (quietly) remarked on his austerity. When you're talking about the character of a person, austerity means \"sternness and severity.\" MNEMONIC: Austerity's original meaning, taken from the Greek word austeros, was \"bitter or harsh taste.\" While it's rarely used that way anymore, it's still a great description of the word's current meanings. As well as describing a personal quality of sternness, it also means \"a simple, plain manner\" and \"an extreme frugality.\" So you could talk about the austerity of a very plainly decorated room or the austerity you're forced to live with ever since your parents stopped giving you a weekly allowance. If your lack of money had a taste, it might very well be \"bitter or harsh.\"", "MEANING: adverb.- in a punctilious manner SENTENCE: When you do something punctiliously, you pay attention to doing it carefully and precisely. During the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace, British soldiers leave their posts punctiliously, following the rules of the ceremony every time. MNEMONIC: Think about the extreme care taken by someone leading a Japanese tea ceremony: they bow, whisk the tea, and pour it, following each step of the ritual precisely and punctiliously. This adverb comes from punctilio, a \"fine point,\" or minor detail. Paying attention to these small rules and details is what acting punctiliously is all about.", "MEANING: adjective.- far-reaching and thoroughgoing in effect especially on the nature of somethingadjective.- (of sleep) deep and completeadjective.- of the greatest intensity; completeadjective.- showing intellectual penetration or emotional depthadjective.- coming from deep within oneadjective.- situated at or extending to great depth; too deep to have been sounded or plumbed SENTENCE: When you need a word that's deeper than \"deep,\" consider profound. A philosopher is likely to make many profound pronouncements. MNEMONIC: Profundus literally means \"deep\" in Latin, and profound had the same meaning when it entered English in the 14th century. But even then, it also meant \"figuratively deep\" \u2014 that is, very great or intense: \"The new laws have had a profound impact.\" Of people, it means \"very knowledgeable or insightful,\" but sometimes when a person tries to sound profound, they're really just giving you superficial knowledge dressed up with big words.", "MEANING: noun.- the marked and rapid transformation of a larva into an adult that occurs in some animalsnoun.- a complete change of physical form or substance especially as by magic or witchcraftnoun.- a striking change in appearance or character or circumstances SENTENCE: In Kafka's novel entitled Metamorphosis, a man wakes up to find he has turned into a cockroach. That kind of complete and startling change pretty much sums up the word. MNEMONIC: When a caterpillar becomes a butterfly, it goes through a metamorphosis. An idea can undergo metamorphosis, or metamorphosize, too as can feelings. After you spend a full summer with your grandmother, your feelings about the woman may undergo a complete metamorphosis. While you were once afraid of the old woman, you now love her dearly.", "MEANING: adjective.- easily irritated or annoyedadjective.- causing irritation or annoyance SENTENCE:  MNEMONIC: ", "MEANING: adjective.- relying on medical quackeryadjective.- derived from experiment and observation rather than theory SENTENCE: If knowledge is empirical, it's based on observation rather than theory. To do an empirical study of donut shops, you'll need to visit every one you can find. MNEMONIC: Empirical looks like empire but comes from a completely different origin: it is from the Greek empeirikos, meaning \"experienced.\" It was originally used in medicine for doctors making choices based on observation and experiment rather than theoretical ideas. It's now used for any kind of knowledge that comes from experience. You can meditate all day on the origins of donuts, but until you visit the donut bakery you'll lack empirical knowledge of donut creation.", "MEANING: noun.- a theory or argument made up of miscellaneous or incongruous ideasnoun.- a motley assortment of things SENTENCE: A hodgepodge is a random assortment of things. A dorm room might be furnished with a hodgepodge of milk crates, antique mirrors, and a poster of a kitten hanging on a branch with one paw. MNEMONIC: Hodgepodge is a funny-sounding word for a somewhat funny occurrence \u2014 a grouping of things or people that don't fit together. If you made a stew with bacon, oatmeal, and chocolate cake, you\u2019ve made a hodgepodge (and a bellyache waiting to happen). The piles of stuff stacked in attics tend to be a hodgepodge. British people call it a hotchpotch. A hodgepodge can also be called a mishmash.", "MEANING: noun.- a collection containing a variety of sorts of thingsnoun.- the act of distributing things into classes or categories of the same type SENTENCE: An assortment is a collection of things that aren't the same. An assortment of chocolates might have some that are filled with coconut, caramel, or nuts. Yum. MNEMONIC: An assortment is a bunch different things all together whether they\u2019re the same sort or not. An assortment of nuts is a bunch of different nuts, such as cashews, peanuts, and almonds. If you have books, candy bars, action figures, photos, and paper clips on your desk, you have an assortment of things. A store that sells a wide variety of products offers an assortment. If you love choices, assortments are for you.", "MEANING: noun.- a structural member used to stiffen a frameworkadjective.- imparting vitality and energy SENTENCE: Anything bracing is brisk and refreshing. A Mainer might consider a January swim in the Atlantic ocean to be bracing, while her Floridian best friend may think she's crazy. MNEMONIC: You probably enjoy the bracing sea air when you're on a sailboat, or the bracing hike you take up the side of a mountain. In both cases, you're filled with energy and feel fortified by the experience. The adjective bracing comes from the verb brace and its figurative meaning, \"to strengthen or comfort.\"", "MEANING: verb.- excuse, overlook, or make allowances for; be lenient with SENTENCE: If you condone something, you allow it, approve of it, or at least can live with it. Some teachers condone chewing gum, and some don't. MNEMONIC: Things that are condoned are allowed, even if everyone isn't exactly thrilled about it. People often say, \"I don't condone what he did, but I understand it.\" Condoning is like excusing something. People seem to talk more about things they don't condone than things they do condone. Your mom might say, \"I don't condone you staying up till 10, but I know you need to read.\" That's a way of giving approval and not giving approval at the same time.", "MEANING: adjective.- severely simpleadjective.- practicing great self-denialadjective.- of a stern or strict bearing or demeanor; forbidding in aspect SENTENCE: The adjective austere is used to describe something or someone stern or without any decoration. You wouldn't want someone to describe you or your home as austere. MNEMONIC: Austere is not usually a positive word because it means that a person or a thing isn't pleasurable. For example, if you go on an austere diet, it's likely you wouldn't ever get to have candy. The adjective  comes into English by way of French, Latin, and Greek, meaning \"harsh\" and \"dry.\" It's pronounced as \"ah-STEER,\" with an emphasis on the second syllable.", "MEANING: verb.- be of useverb.- increase the likelihood of (a response)verb.- make easier SENTENCE: To facilitate means to make something easier. If your best friend is very shy, you could facilitate her efforts to meet new people. MNEMONIC: Facilitate comes from the Latin facilis, for \"easy.\" It means to make something easier or more likely to happen. You facilitate growth or a process, as opposed to, say, dinner.  Often in business meetings someone will be assigned to facilitate a discussion so people don't just sit in awkward silence. Synonyms are ease, simplify, expedite, and assist.", "MEANING: adjective.- (of tumors, e.g.) slow to heal or develop and usually painlessadjective.- disinclined to work or exertion SENTENCE: Indolent is an adjective meaning slow or lazy. It can take an indolent teenager hours to get out of bed on a weekend morning. Often it's noon before he finally comes shuffling down to breakfast in his pajamas. MNEMONIC: An indolent person is slow and lazy \u2014 not the type of person you'd want running your corporation or competing with you in a relay race. Doctors use the word indolent to describe medical conditions that are slow to progress. If you're diagnosed with an illness, you'd prefer an indolent one over one that spreads quickly.", "MEANING: adjective.- only partly in existence; imperfectly formed SENTENCE: Inchoate means just beginning to form. You can have an inchoate idea, like the earliest flickers of images for your masterpiece, or an inchoate feeling, like your inchoate sense of annoyance toward your sister's new talking parrot. MNEMONIC: Inchoate comes from a Latin word for beginning. When something is inchoate, although you don\u2019t yet understand what it is fully, you have a strong sense that it is indeed coming. It\u2019s stronger than the wisp of an idea that never turns into anything. But it\u2019s hard to really find the language to describe an inchoate idea. That\u2019s the whole point: you don\u2019t have the words for it yet!", "MEANING: verb.- form a corporationadjective.- formed or united into a wholeverb.- include or contain; have as a componentverb.- unite or merge with something already in existenceverb.- make into a whole or make part of a whole SENTENCE: To incorporate is to include or integrate a part into the whole. Incorporate is a more active version of the word \"include\"; if you incorporate, you are adding something to the mix. MNEMONIC: In the business world, to incorporate is a legal process. In other usages, the word incorporate really just means to include something or work something into whatever was already existing. You could incorporate your new roommate's furniture into the decor of your apartment, but you may not find a way to incorporate her cat's litter box.", "MEANING: noun.- one whose behavior departs substantially from the norm of a groupadjective.- markedly different from an accepted norm SENTENCE: Use the adjective aberrant to describe unusual conduct. Sitting in a bathtub and singing show tunes all day long might be considered aberrant behavior. MNEMONIC: For conduct that departs from the norm, aberrant is at hand to describe it if you want to set a formal, or even scientific tone to the discussion. You can put the accent on either the first syllable (AB-er-ent) or the second (uh-BER-ent); both pronunciations are acceptable. The Latin root aberrare means \"to go astray,\" from the prefix ab- \"off, away\" plus errare \"to wander.\"  Other descendants of errare in English, like error and errant, have that double -r- and also refer to something that's either not wanted or not expected.", "MEANING: adjective.- diffusing warmth and friendliness SENTENCE: Affable means friendly, pleasant, and easy to talk to. An affable host offers you something to drink and makes you feel at home. MNEMONIC: The adjective affable entered English by way of the Latin word aff\u0101bilis, which means \"kind, friendly.\" If you\u2019re stuck on an airplane next to someone affable, the trip won\u2019t be so bad because that person will be easy to chat with but won\u2019t talk your ear off. Synonyms of affable also refer to a pleasant and mild friendliness, such as genial, hospitable, and gracious. Affable people generally seem like they\u2019re in a good mood and are happy to see you.", "MEANING: noun.- a disposition to be friendly and approachable (easy to talk to) SENTENCE: Affability is the quality of being easy to talk to. If you walk into a party smiling and generally seeming up for whatever, your affability will draw people to you. Affability and intelligence will get you far in this world! MNEMONIC: To be affable is to be friendly and good-natured. The quality itself is called affability. Smiling and making jokes shows affability, and so does being friendly to strangers. Someone who tends to get along with everyone and has many friends has affability. In the Old French, it was affabilit\u00e9, from the Latin root affabilis, for \"approachable, courteous, or kind,\" and literally means \"can be easily spoken to.\"", "MEANING: noun.- malicious satisfactionverb.- gaze at or think about something with great self-satisfaction, gratification, or joyverb.- dwell on with satisfaction SENTENCE: If you gloat, you express great satisfaction at the misfortune of others. If your team scores a big win, it would be better not to gloat. Be happy for your win, but don't laugh at the other team's loss. MNEMONIC: Gloat seems have come from a Germanic word meaning \"to stare.\" Somehow people may have gotten the sense that whoever was doing the staring was also taking a deep and unwholesome pleasure in whatever he or she was seeing. Think about people staring and pointing and laughing. Sometimes you gloat when someone has rejected the help you have offered. If your little sister won't listen to your advice on how to improve her essay and then comes home with a bad grade, it will be very hard not to gloat and say \"I told you so.\"", "MEANING: noun.- malicious satisfaction, synonyms (Gloat) ", "MEANING: adverb.- far from the intended targetadverb.- away from the right path or direction SENTENCE: If you go astray, you lose the path. If you went to college intending to become a doctor, but instead became interested in making violent video games, your parents might feel you have gone astray. MNEMONIC: A stray animal is one that has gotten loose, and the adverb astray comes from this sense of wandering off from the proper place, even though it's not just for animals. If you go astray, you lose the right way, or are out of place. It can be a moral judgment: juvenile delinquents are kids who have gone astray. But it can also refer to small details. If you dress impeccably, you make sure that no thread is astray.", "MEANING: verb.- free somebody (from an erroneous belief) SENTENCE: Disabuse means to free someone of a belief that is not true. Many teachers of health find that when they teach, they spend as much energy disabusing kids of false beliefs as they do giving them the facts. MNEMONIC: Disabuse is often connected to the word notion or idea. In singing lessons, you must disabuse young singers of the idea that they can sing better by singing louder. In the first year of college, many people are disabused of the idea that the way they are is \"normal,\" by meeting so many people who represent other ways to be.", "MEANING: noun.- any of numerous sun-loving low-growing evergreens of the genus Armeria having round heads of pink or white flowersnoun.- extreme care in spending money; reluctance to spend money unnecessarily SENTENCE: Thrift means being very careful about how much money you spend. Reusing the same tea bag ten times so as not to waste money is a kind of thrift. MNEMONIC: The word thrift originally referred to fortune and has come to mean the act of being economical; a thrifty person, or someone who practices thrift, is likely to be fortunate in the sense that he has savings. At a thrift store, you will find inexpensive clothing. You probably don\u2019t want to exercise thrift when deciding on something important, like which brain surgeon to use. You may also find thrift on sunlit mountaintops, in the form of a slender-leaved plant with pink flowers.", "MEANING: verb.- understand the meaning ofverb.- make clearly visiblenoun.- a formal expression by a meeting; agreed to by a votenoun.- the trait of being resoluteverb.- cause to go into a solutionverb.- bring to an end; settle conclusivelyverb.- reach a conclusion after a discussion or deliberationverb.- reach a decisionverb.- find the solution SENTENCE: To resolve is to settle or make a decision about something \u2014 often formal. A college's board of directors  might resolve to recruit more minority students. As a noun, resolve refers to a strong determination to do something. MNEMONIC: If you make a New Year's resolution to exercise every day, you'll need plenty of resolve to stick with your program. The verb descends from Middle English resolven \"to dissolve,\" from Latin resolvere \"to untie.\" In English, the obsolete sense of \"to dissolve\" can be seen in this line from Shakespeare: \"O, that this too too solid flesh would melt, thaw, and resolve itself into a dew.\"", "MEANING: noun.- a small or moderate or token amount SENTENCE: If you want to describe a small amount of something, try modicum. If you have a modicum of interest in something, you are a little bit interested. MNEMONIC: Modicum comes from the Latin modicus, for moderate, and modus, for measure. We often use it to mean \"any at all,\" as if \"If you had a modicum of sense (i.e. any sense at all), you'd be able to see that the pencil you've spent the last five minutes looking for is tucked behind your ear.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- not easily borne; wearing SENTENCE: If one teacher gives you three hours of homework a night, that's rough. But if all of your teachers do it, that makes the task of completing your homework an onerous one, to say the least. If something is onerous, it is very difficult to deal with or do. MNEMONIC: A near synonym is burdensome. In legal usage, onerous describes a contract or lease that has more obligations than advantages. Onerous derives from Middle English, from Old French onereus, from Latin oner\u014dsus, from onus \"burden.\" In English, an onus is a task or duty that is onerous, or very difficult.", "MEANING: verb.- regard with feelings of respect and reverence; consider hallowed or exalted or be in awe of SENTENCE: To venerate is to worship, adore, be in awe of. You probably don't venerate your teacher or boss; however, you may act like you do! MNEMONIC: The word hasn't come far from its Latin roots in venerari, \"to worship.\"  Although you can certainly venerate a deity, a person can deserve it, too. We don't usually venerate our friends: instead, we usually save this feeling for deities or remarkable people who inspire awe. Mother Teresa was venerated for her work with the poor, and Gandhi was venerated for his efforts for peace, but most people aren't venerated for normal stuff like taking out the trash or hanging out on a Saturday.", "MEANING: adjective.- attentive in an ingratiating or servile manneradjective.- attempting to win favor from influential people by flattery SENTENCE: If you disapprove of the overly submissive way someone is acting \u2014 like the teacher's pet or a celebrity's assistant \u2014 call them by the formal adjective obsequious. MNEMONIC: There are many words in the English language for a person or an action that is overly obedient and submissive. Obsequious people are usually not being genuine; they resort to flattery and other fawning ways to stay in the good graces of authority figures. An obsequious person can be called a bootlicker, a brownnoser or a toady. You can also say that someone gives an obsequious bow, a gesture that means, \"your wish is my command.\"", "MEANING: adverb.- with unflagging resolveadverb.- without interruption SENTENCE: Use the adverb incessantly to describe an action that continues or repeats without interruption. The neighbor's dog might bark incessantly in the morning, causing you to complain incessantly about the noise. MNEMONIC: The word incessantly usually indicates that there's something slightly irritating about whatever is happening. The person sitting next to you at the library might be incessantly drumming her fingers on the table. Your little sister might be incessantly singing Disney songs during a long car ride. On the other hand, incessantly can have a more positive meaning, indicating determination or drive. If you work incessantly to prepare for a big presentation, that\u2019s a good thing!", "MEANING: adjective.- marked by good fortuneadjective.- exhibiting an agreeably appropriate manner or style SENTENCE: Felicitous describes something that's pleasantly apt or fitting. Felicitous words you write on your friend's birthday card are the ones that perfectly suit the occasion and make her happy when she reads them. MNEMONIC: Felicitous can mean \"appropriate,\" but it also describes something that's lucky. When you plan a trip to the amusement park and it turns out that the sun is shining, that\u2019s felicitous. If you need to mail a package by a certain date and you make it to the post office just in time, that\u2019s also felicitous. The Latin root of felicitous is felix, \"happy or lucky.\"", "MEANING: verb.- formally reject or disavow a formerly held belief, usually under pressure SENTENCE: If you're someone who speaks before you think, you may need to recant, or take back, that overly honest assessment of your friend's new haircut. MNEMONIC: Recant comes from two Latin roots: the prefix re-, meaning \"back,\" and the verb cantare, meaning \"to sing.\" It has been suggested that recant was first used when someone reversed a charm, curse, or some other type of magical spell that would have been chanted or sung.  Regardless of whether this is true or not, we suggest that you refrain from singing when you need to recant \u2014 unless you've been casting nasty spells on people.", "MEANING: adjective.- showing little emotion SENTENCE: Yes, phlegmatic has roots in that colorless, mucousy stuff called phlegm, but people who are phlegmatic aren't called that because they have lots of mucus. They are just a little dull in expressing feelings or showing emotion. MNEMONIC: It may be their training more than their natural behavior, but those palace guards who wear the red coats and big hats and show absolutely no expression on their faces are phlegmatic. Attempts to make them laugh, smile, or twist their faces in irritation won\u2019t work, because being phlegmatic is important to their role as stone-faced keepers of the palace. Phlegmatic people show less emotion on the outside \u2014 but who knows, they may be jumping up and down on the inside.", "MEANING: noun.- a state of lawlessness and disorder (usually resulting from a failure of government) SENTENCE: Use the noun anarchy to describe a complete lack of government \u2014 or the chaotic state of affairs created by such an absence. A substitute teacher might worry that an unruly classroom will descend into anarchy. MNEMONIC: From the Greek for \"without a ruler\" we get this word for the political philosophy that the best government is no government at all \u2014 a movement that enjoyed surprising success worldwide in the early and middle parts of the twentieth century. Today, the word is more commonly used to describe not a political ideal but a state of total disorder, chaos and even violence: \"A type of bloody anarchy is beginning to reign.\" A good synonym would be \"lawlessness.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- marked by lack of definite plan or regularity or purpose; jumping from one thing to another SENTENCE: If you lack a definite plan or purpose and flit from one thing to another, your actions are desultory. Some people call such desultory wanderings spontaneous. Others call it \"being lost.\" MNEMONIC: The adjective desultory comes from the word desultor, which was a circus rider who would leap from the back of one galloping horse onto another. From this literal sense of jumping from one thing to another, we get the modern meaning of desultory as jumping between things without a logical purpose.", "MEANING: verb.- expose while ridiculing; especially of pretentious or false claims and ideas SENTENCE: When you debunk something you show it to be false. Many magicians, including Houdini and Penn and Teller, have worked to debunk the idea that magic is anything other than a very clever illusion. MNEMONIC: To debunk something is to prove it wrong. The idea that music education is frivolous and should be the first item cut from the budget is something that music teachers work hard to debunk \u2014 in fact, they've done it by proving that students perform better in schools with strong music programs. The verb debunk was first used by an American writer, William Woodward, in 1923, to mean \"take the bunk out of something.\" Bunk means \"nonsense.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- being without doubt or reserveadjective.- implied though not directly expressed; inherent in the nature of something SENTENCE: Use the adjective implicit when you mean that something is understood but not clearly stated. You might think you and your boyfriend might have an implicit understanding that you are going to get married, but it's probably better to talk it through. MNEMONIC: A very near synonym of implicit in this particular meaning is the word implied. But the adjective implicit  also means \"complete without any doubt,\" so we can say that we have implicit trust or confidence in someone. The Latin root implic\u0101re means \"to involve or entangle.\" Another English word with a more obvious connection to the Latin is the verb implicate.", "MEANING: adjective.- being or involving basic facts or principlesadjective.- not fully developed in mature animalsadjective.- being in the earliest stages of development SENTENCE: Rudimentary means basic, or at a very early stage. The test should be easy: it requires only a rudimentary understanding of the materials. MNEMONIC: The word rude means simple or offensive \u2014 and people with only rudimentary understanding of good manners might not know how that belching is rude. If you remember that the word rude is the foundation of rudimentary, you'll have a rudimentary understanding of the word.", "MEANING: adjective.- marked by care and persistent effort SENTENCE: If you call someone assiduous, it's a compliment. It means they're careful, methodical and very persistent. Good detectives are classically assiduous types. MNEMONIC: Assiduous comes from two Latin words: assiduus, meaning \"busy incessant, continual or constant,\" and assidere, meaning \"to sit down to\" something. (Funnily enough, we also get the word sedentary, meaning someone who doesn't move around much, a lazy couch potato, from this same last word.) Although we tend to think of sedentary types as being the very opposite of assiduous ones, many assiduous activities (like writing, thinking, or detective work) are best done sitting in a chair.", "MEANING: adjective.- containing or characterized by error SENTENCE: The adjective erroneous describes something or someone as mistaken and incorrect. Early explorers had the erroneous notion that the oceans were full of dragons. MNEMONIC: When we talk about being on the \"straight and narrow path\" we aim to live a truthful and moral life. The Latin root of erroneous, or \"to be incorrect\" as well as \"to be immoral,\" is errare, which means \"to wander.\" It's clear that we make connections between behavior and direction or space. These two ideas have been linked for a very long time!", "MEANING: adjective.- unaffected by self-interest SENTENCE: If you can't decide whether to purchase the shirt with orange polka dots or the purple paisley-patterned one, you might seek input from a disinterested, or unbiased, party (who will probably tell you not to buy either one). MNEMONIC: Depending on whom you ask, disinterested is either one of the most commonly misused words in the English language, or a perfect example of usage experts and English teachers being way too uptight. While everyone agrees that disinterested can mean \u201cunbiased,\u201d the debate rages on as to whether it can also mean \u201cuninterested\u201d or \u201cindifferent.\u201d Sticklers are vehemently opposed to this secondary meaning. (Of course, you\u2019ll also find the disinterested \u2014 or uninterested? \u2014 folks who couldn\u2019t care less.)", "MEANING: adjective.- corresponding in function but not in evolutionary originadjective.- similar or equivalent in some respects though otherwise dissimilar SENTENCE: Use the adjective analogous to describe something that is similar to something else and can be compared to another. MNEMONIC: Analogous things can be compared to each other, so a near synonym is the adjective comparable. Analogous is a term used in biology to refer to body parts that have a similar function but differ in structure, such as the wings of a bird and the wings of an airplane. Analogous is from Latin analogus, from Greek analogos, meaning \"according to a proper ratio or proportion.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- puffed up with vanityadjective.- lofty in style SENTENCE: Grandiloquent is a fancy term for, well, being fancy or pretentious. In fact, you might say grandiloquent is itself a pretty grandiloquent word. MNEMONIC: The word grandiloquent generally refers to the way a person behaves or speaks. Politicians and schoolteachers are the usual suspects of this manner of behavior, known as grandiloquence, but it can refer to anything that's overbearing or pompous in style or manner. Architecture, especially, is highly guilty of being grandiloquent \u2014 if you check out just about anything built in the Baroque style, you could describe it as grandiloquent.", "MEANING: noun.- brace consisting of a bar or rod used to resist longitudinal compressionnoun.- a proud stiff pompous gaitverb.- walk with a lofty proud gait, often in an attempt to impress others SENTENCE: When you strut, you walk with a proud swagger that has a little arrogance thrown in, like the prance of a running back who has just flown past the 250-pound linebackers and planted the ball in the end zone. MNEMONIC: You can't strut and be shy about it \u2014 when you strut, you know people are watching you. The big boss in a gangster film, a model on the runway, and the rap artist whose album has just gone platinum all know how to strut. The noun form of strut has a little less flash and refers to a vertical or horizontal support that holds something up, like the long steel bars holding up a building.", "MEANING: adjective.- full of trivial conversation SENTENCE: A garrulous person just won\u2019t stop talking (and talking, and talking, and talking...). MNEMONIC: Garrulous comes from the Latin word garrire for \"chattering or prattling.\" If someone is garrulous, he doesn't just like to talk; he indulges in talking for talking\u2019s sake \u2014 whether or not there\u2019s a real conversation going on. If you discover that you have a garrulous neighbor sitting next to you on the plane, you might just want to feign sleep, unless you really want to hear everything going through his mind for the entire trip.", "MEANING: noun.- a guidebook for travelersnoun.- a proposed route of travelnoun.- an established line of travel or access SENTENCE: An itinerary is your travel plan \u2014 where you will go and when you will be there. MNEMONIC: If you make plans to fly to Paris from Beijing or take a train to Chicago from Mexico City, you will need an itinerary. That means you will have a plan that displays how you will get from point to point in your travels and when you will be at each point. This word comes from the Middle English itinerarius and is defined as being \"about a journey.\" Itineraries can be really useful because if you give your mother yours, she will always know where you are!", "MEANING: adjective.- temperamentally disinclined to talkadjective.- cool and formal in manneradjective.- reluctant to draw attention to yourself SENTENCE: Reticent means either quiet or restrained. If you're reticent about your feelings, you like to keep them to yourself, and you're probably quiet in rowdy groups where everyone is talking over each other. MNEMONIC: The original meaning of reticent describes someone who doesn\u2019t like to talk. Be careful in your context, however. Reticent can refer to someone who is restrained and formal, but it can also refer to someone who doesn\u2019t want to draw attention to herself or who prefers seclusion to other people. Don\u2019t confuse reticent with reluctant, which means unwilling.", "MEANING: verb.- make peace with SENTENCE: If you forgot flowers on your Mom's birthday, you can still propitiate her by sending a bouquet the next day. Propitiate means to appease someone or make them happy by doing a particular thing. Handy strategy for lovers, too. MNEMONIC: One of the most common uses of propitiate historically was in the sense of appeasing the Gods, often  with a gift in the form of an animal or human sacrifice. Fortunately, for most people today flowers and candy will do the trick. But then again, some Moms can be tough to appease.", "MEANING: noun.- an external tracheal aperture in a terrestrial arthropodnoun.- the apical end of the style where deposited pollen enters the pistilnoun.- a skin lesion that is a diagnostic sign of some diseasenoun.- a symbol of disgrace or infamy SENTENCE: If something has a negative association attached to it, call this a stigma. Bed-wetting can lead to a social stigma for a six year old, while chewing tobacco might have the same effect for a sixty year old. MNEMONIC: Stigma, from the Greek word of the same spelling meaning \"mark, puncture,\" came into English through Latin to mean a mark burned into the skin to signify disgrace. It did not take long for stigma to be used figuratively, as it is commonly used today, for the negative stereotype or reputation attached to something such as \"the stigma of divorce.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- extremely painful SENTENCE: Being attacked by a hungry shark or being chased by an unruly mob on the streets can be described as harrowing, which means \"provoking feelings of fear or horror.\" MNEMONIC: The adjective harrowing is often used to describe a firsthand experience that is terrifying, such as a harrowing drive home in icy weather, but it can also refer to a secondhand experience, such as reading or watching something that is very frightening or disturbing. If you read someone\u2019s account of being shipwrecked in Antarctica, you might describe that as a harrowing story. A harrowing experience typically unfolds over a period of time. For example, if you bump into a shark while swimming, that\u2019s merely scary. If the shark attacks you, then it becomes a harrowing ordeal.", "MEANING: verb.- be deliberately ambiguous or unclear in order to mislead or withhold information SENTENCE: When you prevaricate, you lie or mislead. Now, go ahead and tell me whether you already knew that meaning, and don\u2019t prevaricate about it \u2014 give me the story straight! MNEMONIC: While prevaricate basically means to lie, it also has the sense of making it hard to know exactly what the lie was. You talk in a confusing way, go back and forth, and as deliberately as possible mislead someone. Government officials, bureaucrats, and sneaky types prevaricate in the hopes that it will be too difficult to figure out whether they've been doing something wrong. Don't prevaricate with your parents \u2014 it will definitely make you look guilty, but they just won't be sure of what!", "MEANING: noun.- intentional vagueness or ambiguitynoun.- a statement that deviates from or perverts the truthnoun.- the deliberate act of deviating from the truth SENTENCE: Prevarication is when someone tells a lie, especially in a sneaky way. A boy might use prevarication to avoid telling the whole truth about how the kitchen window got broken. MNEMONIC: While the noun prevarication is mostly just a fancy way to say \"lie,\" it can also mean skirting around the truth, being vague about the truth, or even delaying giving someone an answer, especially to avoid telling them the whole truth. In the 16th century, the word was used to mean \"going astray,\" or \"stepping out of line.\" It comes from the Latin root word praevaricari, which literally translates as \"walk crookedly.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- allowing fluids or gases to pass or diffuse through SENTENCE: Something that is permeable can be passed through, especially by liquids or gases. \"I wish I hadn't worn my permeable sweater to the picnic when the weatherman called for thunderstorms. The rain seeped right through the fabric, soaking me to the skin.\" MNEMONIC: A permeable surface allows materials like liquids to pass through \u2014 either in or out. Inside the body, the walls of cells are permeable membranes that allow fluids and nutrients to get in and nourish the cells. A permeable shirt is good to wear in the summer, because it helps release the sweat sticking to the skin.", "MEANING: adjective.- contingent on something elseadjective.- restricted in meaning; (as e.g. `man' in `a tall man')adjective.- limited or restricted; not absoluteadjective.- holding appropriate documentation and officially on record as qualified to perform a specified function or practice a specified skilladjective.- meeting the proper standards and requirements and training for an office or position or task SENTENCE: Qualified means something depends on another action occurring. If your friend receives a qualified offer on her house, that means something else has to happen \u2014 like a bank approving the loan \u2014 before it's sold. MNEMONIC: Qualified is an adjective with multiple meanings. Employers seek the most qualified applicants, meaning those who have the most experience and relevant training. Being qualified might also mean you have paperwork that shows you had certain training or meet certain standards. Or qualified can mean \"partial\" or \"incomplete.\" If you approve of something but others need to agree before it's final, you would give your qualified approval.", "MEANING: noun.- any chemical substance that burns or destroys living tissueadjective.- harsh or corrosive in toneadjective.- of a substance, especially a strong acid; capable of destroying or eating away by chemical action SENTENCE: Use the adjective caustic to describe any chemical that is able to burn living tissue or other substances, or, figuratively, a statement that has a similarly burning effect. Caustic in this sense means harshly critical. MNEMONIC: In the chemical sense, a near synonym is corrosive. In the figurative sense, near synonyms are biting, scathing, and sarcastic. The source of the word caustic is Latin causticus, from Greek kaustikos, from kaiein \"to burn.\"", "MEANING: noun.- a pike with a long tapering double-edged blade with lateral projections; 16th and 17th centuriesadjective.- devoted to a cause or partynoun.- an ardent and enthusiastic supporter of some person or activitynoun.- a fervent and even militant proponent of something SENTENCE: If something is prejudicial towards a particular point of view, you can call it partisan. You'll often hear of the partisan politics in the U.S.\u2014 since politicians seem to be completely devoted to the agendas of their own parties. MNEMONIC: Partisan can be used to describe rabid supporters of any person or activity. In American English, however, it is most often used to refer to politics and the American two-party system of Democrats and Republicans. A bill introduced may have partisan support from the party that introduced the bill, or \u2014 more rarely it seems to American voters \u2014 the bill may even have bipartisan support. The prefix bi is added to show the support from both parties.", "MEANING: noun.- lining consisting of material with a high melting point; used to line the inside walls of a furnaceadjective.- temporarily unresponsive or not fully responsive to nervous or sexual stimuliadjective.- not responding to treatmentadjective.- stubbornly resistant to authority or control SENTENCE: Imagine yourself pulling a dog who doesn't want to walk. The dog is refractory, or stubbornly resisting your authority. MNEMONIC: The word refractory comes from a Latin word meaning \"obstinate\" and can also be used to mean \"not responsive to something.\" If you have a cold you can't shake, you could say you have a refractory cough. The word can also be used to describe a material that maintains its strength at very high heats. The outside of a space shuttle is made of refractory material, so that it can reenter the atmosphere without burning up.", "MEANING: adjective.- full of trivial conversation SENTENCE: A loquacious person talks a lot, often about stuff that only they think is interesting. You can also call them chatty or gabby, but either way, they're loquacious. MNEMONIC: Whenever you see the Latin loqu-, you can be sure that the word has something to do with \"talking.\" So a loquacious person is a person who talks a lot, and often too much. Sitting next to a loquacious person at a dinner party can make dinner a real drag. Of course, if you've got nothing to say, a loquacious person might make a good dinner companion, because they'll do all the talking. All you will have to do is smile and eat.", "MEANING: adjective.- unaware of or indifferent toadjective.- unresponsive to stimulationadjective.- incapable of physical sensationadjective.- barely able to be perceived SENTENCE: The adjective insensible is used to describe someone who is unconscious. If you keep your bowling ball on the top shelf of the closet and it rolls out and conks you on the head, you will be probably rendered insensible. MNEMONIC: The adjective insensible describes a lack of emotional response or being indifferent. If your friend says that the roller coaster was so scary it nearly made him vomit and you shrug and say, \"Eh, it was okay,\" he may think you are insensible to fear. A lack of physical sensation can also be described as insensible. If your nerve endings are not acute and you don't feel much pain, you are insensible to pain. This can be dangerous, though, because you might not notice if you get hurt skateboarding.", "MEANING: verb.- make easierverb.- provide physical relief, as from pain SENTENCE: Do all these words make your head ache? If so, take an aspirin to alleviate, or relieve, your pain. MNEMONIC: The verb, alleviate, stems from the Latin root, levis \"light\" and is related to modern English words such as elevator and levitate \u2014 both words implying a lightening of one's load. Alleviate also has this sense of lightening a burden such as physical pain or emotional duress. You can take medicine to alleviate symptoms or do exercise to alleviate stress. Or if you want a bigger challenge: try alleviating traffic congestion or world hunger.", "MEANING: verb.- be in contradiction withverb.- prove negative; show to be falseverb.- deny the truth ofverb.- make ineffective by counterbalancing the effect of SENTENCE: If something neutralizes the effect of something else, then you can say the effect is negated. Hanging a disco ball from your living room ceiling negates the sleek modern effect created by the contemporary furniture. MNEMONIC: If something is proved false or untrue, it has been negated. The discovery of one dinosaur jaw negated the conventional wisdom that all dinosaurs were vegetarians, since the tooth structure proved that guy definitely ate meat. The verb negate can also mean to counteract or counterbalance \u2014 so a really strong serve can negate your other weaknesses on the tennis court.", "MEANING: adjective.- capable of woundingadjective.- strong and sharp;\"the pungent taste of radishes\" SENTENCE: Use pungent to describe a taste or smell that gives a sharp sensation. \"What is that pungent odor?\" is a polite way of suggesting that someone in the room has BO. MNEMONIC: The ultimate source of the word pungent is Latin pungere \"to prick, sting.\" Ginger and mustard seed are examples of pungent spices. Limburger cheese has the distinction of being the most pungent of all cheeses. And if your pet has an accident in the house, there may be a pungent odor. And pungent can be used in a figurative sense: pungent language is stimulating and expressive.", "MEANING: adjective.- sparing in consumption of especially food and drinkadjective.- marked by temperance in indulgence SENTENCE: Reserve abstemious for someone who exercises restraint, especially with regard to alcohol. A rock musician may sing about enjoying wine and women, but in his private life he may be abstemious. MNEMONIC: You might get the idea that abstemious is a relative of abstain with a change of consonant, but in fact the two words only share the abs- prefix, meaning \"away.\" The -temious bit in this adjective is from Latin temetum, \"intoxicating drink,\" so it came to refer to someone who keeps alcohol (or other temptations) at arm's length. This word has the vowels a, e, i, o and u in alphabetical order; the adverb abstemiously adds the y!", "MEANING: adjective.- tending to discourage (especially of prices) SENTENCE: That expensive Ferrari in the showroom? You may want it, but its price is prohibitive \u2014 which means the price is discouragingly high and likely to deter you from buying. MNEMONIC: Prohibitive originally referred to something (often a law) that prohibits or forbids something, but it came to mean conditions (often prices or taxes) so high or great they restrict or prevent something: \"To some, the cost of child care is prohibitive.\" The stress is on the second syllable, just like the verb: pro-HIB-i-tive. If it's a matter of expense, a synonym is exorbitant.", "MEANING: adjective.- fair to all parties as dictated by reason and conscience SENTENCE: Equitable distribution means everyone gets their fair share of something.If you work on a group project in class, you want an equitable share of the credit. MNEMONIC: When you look at equitable, you might think you see the word, equal, but it doesn't mean fair in the sense of exactly the same. If you worked ten hours at a lemonade stand and your friend worked five, you'd want an equitable share of the profits rather than an equal share. Equitable would take into account the amount of work you did, equal would not.", "MEANING: adjective.- having or revealing little emotion or sensibility; not easily aroused or excited SENTENCE: A stolid person can\u2019t be moved to smile or show much sign of life, in much the same way as something solid, like a giant boulder, is immovable. Both are expressionless. MNEMONIC: It's hard to get excited about the word stolid. It refers to emotionless people or things, and it even sounds pretty dull. Your face may be stolid, as you plod through the unemotional history of the word born in the 17th century of little more than Latin words for \"foolish.\" In some definitions, stolid does have more complimentary synonyms, such as \"dependable\" or \"calm,\" but these can be overshadowed by other words for stolid \u2014 \"empty,\" \"blank,\" and \"vacant,\" to name a few.", "MEANING: noun.- a broken piece of a brittle artifact SENTENCE: If you break a mirror, the thin sharp pieces you want to avoid are shards. A shard is simply a broken piece of metal, glass, stone, or pottery with sharp edges. MNEMONIC: Don't confuse shard with shred, meaning to cut into strips, or chard, a leafy green vegetable. You could use a shard of metal to shred chard into salad, but be careful that you don't cut your hands to shreds!", "MEANING: adjective.- bearing in abundance especially offspringadjective.- intellectually productive SENTENCE: Someone or something that is prolific is fruitful or highly productive. A prolific songwriter can churn out five hit tunes before breakfast. MNEMONIC: It is interesting to note that many of the words used to describe the adjective prolific are relayed in biological terms, such as \"to give birth,\" \"nourish,\" and \"fertile.\" Other uses of the word pertain to having many ideas or an active and expressive mind, such as a \"prolific writer.\" Clearly, people like to consider that the ideas or things that they make are in some way produced by them like flowers or fruit!", "MEANING: adjective.- expressing yourself readily, clearly, effectivelyadjective.- performing adroitly and without effortadjective.- arrived at without due care or effort; lacking depth SENTENCE: If someone does something easily, or shows ease, it is described as facile in a good way, but if someone takes the easy way out and shows a lack of thought or care, it is facile in a bad way. MNEMONIC: While it is a lovely sounding French word, facile is both a compliment and an insult depending on how it's used. Something that shows ready skill is facile, such as being facile with text messaging. But if something is too simple and superficial, or shows little care, it can also be called facile. \"Being too cowardly to tell the truth and admit he didn't do it, he used the facile and sarcastic excuse that the dog ate his homework.\"", "MEANING: noun.- the intolerance and prejudice of a bigot SENTENCE: Dogmatism is a way of thinking that is stubborn and narrow-minded, often because of prejudice and bigotry. MNEMONIC: This word has nothing to do with dogs. Rather, it has to do with being dogmatic: holding onto a view or set of views no matter what. The noun form is dogmatism, which is often a type of prejudice such as racism or sexism. Dogmatism includes a disregard for other people's opinions: there's no compromise possible.", "MEANING: noun.- someone who habitually doubts accepted beliefs SENTENCE: A skeptic is a person who doesn't believe something is true unless they see evidence. As a skeptic, you refuse to believe your sister saw a ghost \u2014 after all, she can't prove it. MNEMONIC: Skeptics are doubters \u2014 they need to see proof before they will believe. If you're a skeptic, you're probably dubious about things like astrology and magic. Some skeptics feel the same way about religion, preferring facts that can be scientifically and historically proven. Coming from the Greek word skeptikos, which means \"thoughtful or inquiring,\" it's no surprise that a skeptic is someone who asks a lot of questions \u2014 and isn't easily convinced.", "MEANING: adjective.- not dangerous to health; not recurrent or progressive (especially of a tumor)adjective.- pleasant and beneficial in nature or influenceadjective.- kind in disposition or manner SENTENCE: Someone or something that is benign is gentle, kind, mild, or unharmful: a benign soul wouldn't hurt a fly. MNEMONIC: Benign describes a range of qualities, all of them positive. When talking about a person, it means \"gentle.\" In reference to weather or climate, it means \"mild.\" In some other contexts, it simply means \"not harmful\"; you might speak of \"a benign tumor\" or \"an environmentally benign chemical.\" The word comes from a Latin root benignus meaning \"well born,\" but the implied meaning is \"kind\" or \"pleasant\" \u2014 it's hard to get mad at someone who has a benign disposition.", "MEANING: adjective.- brief and to the point; effectively cut short SENTENCE: Laconic is an adjective that describes a style of speaking or writing that uses only a few words, often to express complex thoughts and ideas.  A more laconic way to write that last sentence might be this: laconic means brief. MNEMONIC: There\u2019s a friend of yours who doesn\u2019t talk very much, and when he does, he says maybe three words and then becomes quiet again.  You could describe that friend as laconic.  The word comes from Laconia, a region in ancient Greece where the local Spartan rulers gave very short speeches.  Being laconic can be bad when it sounds rude to be so brief, but it can be good if you\u2019re in a rush to get somewhere.", "MEANING: adjective.- hasty and without attention to detail; not thorough SENTENCE: No reason to get excited \u2014 cursory has nothing to do with bad language. Instead, it means not paying attention to details, like friends who are so busy studying for a test that they only give your new haircut a cursory glance. MNEMONIC: Cursory dates to the early 17th century, from the French word cursoire meaning \"rapid,\" which comes from the Latin word cursorius, meaning \"hasty, of a race or running.\" Something that is cursory is done quickly. A teacher might take a cursory look at a pile of completed tests, not to grade them, but to see if anyone attempted the bonus questions.", "MEANING: adjective.- having no cause or apparent causeadjective.- occurring by happy chance SENTENCE: Fortuitous means by chance, like a lucky accident. If you and your best friend's families happen to go on vacation to the same place at the same time, that\u2019s a fortuitous coincidence! MNEMONIC: Something fortuitous is random like an accident, but there\u2019s no downside. A rock falling on your head is an accident, dollar bills falling on your head is fortuitous. The meaning of fortuitous is changing from \"happening by chance\" to \"lucky chance\" because people get it mixed up with fortunate.  But watch out: If you say fortuitous to mean just plain lucky without the element of chance \u2013\u2013 that's a usage error.", "MEANING: adjective.- of the grey-green color of sage leavesnoun.- aromatic fresh or dried grey-green leaves used widely as seasoning for meats and fowl and game etcnoun.- any of various plants of the genus Salvia; a cosmopolitan herbadjective.- having wisdom that comes with age and experiencenoun.- a mentor in spiritual and philosophical topics who is renowned for profound wisdom SENTENCE: Use the word sage for someone or something wise and judicious. Thanks to the sage advice of your friend, you didn't write your teacher an angry e-mail! MNEMONIC: Although you might think of a wizard when you hear the word sage, really it means a wise man. Today you see it used to refer to someone who has insight in a particular field. If someone is a policy sage, he knows just what advice to give politicians to make them understand the issue and respond successfully to it. In a totally unrelated use, there is also a plant called sage that is useful in home remedies and cooking.", "MEANING: adjective.- difficult to penetrate; incomprehensible to one of ordinary understanding or knowledge SENTENCE: It's rather difficult to penetrate the meaning of recondite. Fitting, because it's an adjective that basically means hard for the average mind to understand. MNEMONIC: If it's really hard to comprehend, then it's safe to say it's recondite.  In the same family as \"abstruse,\" \"esoteric\" and \"totally deep, man,\" recondite is a very serious word that you could use to describe obscure philosophy books, high level mathematical theory, and the series finale of The Sopranos \u2014 you know, things that make your brain hurt.", "MEANING: noun.- the state of being omniscient; having infinite knowledge SENTENCE: Many people believe in the omniscience or all-knowing power of God. MNEMONIC: Omniscience comes from the Latin omnis meaning \"all\" and scientia meaning \"knowledge.\" Omniscience is a state of possessing all the knowledge there is \u2014 pretty impressive.  In a religious sense, people believe in a higher being that has omniscience.  In literature, omniscience can refer to the perspective of a narrator who is all-knowing or has the ability to see into the minds of all his characters.", "MEANING: verb.- serve or summon with a subpoenanoun.- a writ issued by court authority to compel the attendance of a witness at a judicial proceeding; disobedience may be punishable as a contempt of court SENTENCE: A subpoena is a document that requires its recipient to appear in court as a witness. If you receive a subpoena, it doesn't mean you've done anything wrong; it just means you may have information that's needed by the court. MNEMONIC: Subpoena can also be a verb: You can subpoena someone by giving them a subpoena. If you receive a subpoena but fail to carry out its instructions, you're in big trouble. This fact is suggested by the Latin roots of this word: the prefix sub- means \"under\" and poena means \"penalty.\" One nice thing about a subpoena is that it's not a summons; if you get one of those, it means you're being sued.", "MEANING: adjective.- free of deceit SENTENCE: If you are guileless, you are not a liar; you are innocent, and you might be a touch on the gullible side. MNEMONIC: To be guileless is to be without guile. Guile is \"deceit, duplicity and trickery.\" The young and uninitiated are the ones we call guileless, and they are the ones who often get stung by the more heartless among us. You might recall being a guileless freshman trying out for the school play, and being told by a veteran performer that it would be best to come to the audition for Our Town in a chicken costume, so you did.", "MEANING: verb.- make less active or intenseverb.- become less in amount or intensity SENTENCE: Something that abates becomes fewer or less intense. Your enthusiasm for skiing might abate after falling off a ski lift and getting a mouthful of snow. MNEMONIC: Abate comes from the Old French verb abattre, \"to beat down,\" and means to reduce or become less intense or numerous. As an intransitive verb, it is often used with something physically, emotionally, or figuratively violent, as in \"the flood of fan mail began to abate.\" Using it transitively, if you take measures to abate pollution or noise, you reduce them. Pronounce abate with the stress on the second syllable (uh-BATE).", "MEANING: noun.- someone shirking their duty by feigning illness or incapacity SENTENCE: Have you ever pretended to be sick or hurt to get out of taking a test or doing a chore? Then you, my dear, are a malingerer, and should be ashamed of yourself. Shape up! MNEMONIC: Knowing that the prefix mal is from the Latin for \u201cbad,\u201d we can tell right off that being a malingerer is not a good thing. This noun form of the verb malinger comes from the French malingre which means \u201csickly.\u201d (Obviously, it\u2019s bad to pretend to be sick.) In Jack London\u2019s Call of the Wild, the new dog, Pike, is referred to as \u201ca clever malingerer and thief,\u201d giving a clear negative context to the word.", "MEANING: verb.- avoid responsibilities and duties, e.g., by pretending to be ill SENTENCE: When you malinger, you pretend to be sick. If you ever claimed to have a stomach ache in order to stay home from school, you know what it means to malinger. MNEMONIC: The word malinger comes from the French malingre, which can mean \"ailing or sickly,\" but its exact origin is uncertain. One theory says that mal, or \"wrongly,\" suggests the sick person is just faking. Lying about a stomach ache, holding the thermometer near a light bulb, refusing to get out of bed, moaning \u2014 these are classic tactics of those who malinger, or pretend to be too sick to do anything but lie around the house.", "MEANING: noun.- a person who shirks his work or duty (especially one who tries to evade military service in wartime)", "MEANING: verb.- avoid dealing withverb.- avoid (one's assigned duties) SENTENCE: To shirk your responsibilities is to avoid dealing with them \u2014 like when you watch four consecutive hours of infomercials instead of facing your homework. MNEMONIC: A verb is an action word, so it's ironic that the verb shirk suggests inaction in the avoidance of work. To shirk carries with it a negative connotation of laziness. When Eleanor Roosevelt was asked how she conquered her shyness to become a powerful public figure, she responded, \"I faced each problem as it came along. . . . I never tried to shirk. I tried never to evade an issue. When I found I had something to do \u2014 I just did it.\" Ah, Eleanor, why can't we all be a bit more like you?", "MEANING: verb.- be immersed inverb.- roll around, \"pigs were wallowing in the mud\"verb.- toss, roll, or rise and fall in an uncontrolled waynoun.- a confused multitude of things SENTENCE: Use the noun welter to describe an enormous, messy pile, like the jumble of papers, coffee mugs, pens, and food wrappers on the desk of the messiest person in the office. MNEMONIC: Welter can also be a verb \u2014 the items in the pile on the messy desk welter every time someone tries to pull something out. This means they roll and get tossed around. Maybe the person isn't as messy as you think. Possibly his projects keep him so weltered \u2014 meaning \"deeply involved\" \u2014 that he doesn't have the time or energy to deal with the mess.", "MEANING: adjective.- devoid of intelligence SENTENCE: Fatuous means lacking intelligence. When your mother outlaws calling your brother stupid, use fatuous instead. MNEMONIC: Fatuous derives from the Latin fatuus meaning \"foolish.\" It sounds like it should have something to do with being fat, but it actually has no relation to size. Fatuus itself comes from a root that also gave us \"debate\" and this might be a good way to remember it. You want to debate someone who's fatuous, because they are unintelligent, silly and even a bit conceited, so they probably won't be very persuasive debaters. Just don't call them fatuous to their face. Even if they don't know what it means, it's just not nice!", "MEANING: verb.- arouse unreasoning love or passion in and cause to behave in an irrational way SENTENCE: Have you ever had a ridiculous crush that's made you act foolishly? That person infatuated or inspired unreasonable passion in you, causing you to become infatuated. MNEMONIC: Infatuate comes from the Latin infatuat- meaning \"made foolish.\" When you are head-over-heels for someone, you might have a tendency to act foolish. Most commonly, you'll see the word used in the term \"to be infatuated with.\" When you are infatuated with someone, you're so enamored that you might behave in an irrational way. Stalkers tend to be infatuated with the subjects of their stalking.", "MEANING: noun.- a loud harsh or strident noisenoun.- loud confusing disagreeable sounds SENTENCE: A cacophony is a mishmash of unpleasant sounds, often at loud volume. It's what you'd hear if you gave instruments to a group of four-year-olds and asked them to play one of Beethoven's symphonies. MNEMONIC: A cacophony is a jarring, discordant mix of sounds that have no business being played together. When the orchestra tunes up before a show, it sounds like a cacophony because each musician is playing a completely different tune, at different times, and at different volumes. Once the show begins, that cacophony had better turn into a melody, or audiences will demand a refund. This allegedly occurred during the first time Igor Stravinsky's score for the ballet \"The Rite of Spring\" was performed because its difficult composition and discordant tone was shocking.", "MEANING: noun.- the trait of being intransigent; stubbornly refusing to compromise SENTENCE: If you refuse to compromise with your sister about whose turn it is to do the dishes, your mother might accuse you both of intransigence. Intransigence is a stubborn refusal to change your views. MNEMONIC: Inside of intransigence you see the Latin transigere which means to come to an understanding. People who show intransigence refuse to do this. Nations are often accused of intransigence when they refuse to comply with international standards or will.", "MEANING: verb.- disturb in mind or make uneasy or cause to be worried or alarmednoun.- the trait of seeming ill at easenoun.- a feeling of mild anxiety about possible developments SENTENCE: If you feel a sense of disquiet, you're worried or anxious about something. Disquiet at the dinner table means that everyone feels upset or on edge. MNEMONIC: You can use the word disquiet as a noun or a verb. A feeling of disquiet might fill you as you walk slowly through a truly spooky haunted house. You can also say that a low, frightening sound coming from the room ahead disquiets you. The word dates from the 1500s, a combination of dis, \"lack of\" or \"not\" in Latin, and quiet, from the Latin root quietus, \"calm, at rest, or free from exertion.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- causing mental discomfort SENTENCE: When something really upsets or worries you, you can describe it as disquieting. The very best horror movies are supposed to be disquieting. MNEMONIC: Scary TV shows and books are disquieting, and even the local news or a documentary can be a bit disquieting, making you feel uncomfortable or rattled. In other words, they upset you with disturbing ideas, images, or subjects. You could also describe disquieting things as unsettling or distressing. The Latin roots are dis, \"not,\" and quies, \"peace.\"", "MEANING: noun.- correct or appropriate behavior SENTENCE: Propriety is following what is socially acceptable in speech and behavior. If you are someone who cares about always doing the right and proper thing, your friends might accuse you of being obsessed with propriety and beg you to loosen up. MNEMONIC: In the Victorian Age, both sexes had well-defined roles and were expected to exercise self-restraint. Except for the men. Everyone looked the other way when they went out on benders. Their wives at home however, were so confined by the era's standards of propriety that if a woman so much as referred to the fact that she was pregnant, everyone would cover their mouths and gasp. She'd committed an impropriety.", "MEANING: adjective.- pertaining to or characteristic of an ascetic or the practice of rigorous self-disciplineadjective.- practicing great self-denialnoun.- someone who practices self denial as a spiritual discipline SENTENCE: Want to live an ascetic lifestyle? Then you better ditch the flat panel TV and fuzzy slippers. To be ascetic, you learn to live without; it's all about self-denial. MNEMONIC: Ascetic is derived from the Greek asketes, meaning \u201cmonk,\u201d or \u201chermit.\u201d Later that became asketikos, meaning \u201crigorously self-disciplined,\u201d which gives us the Modern English ascetic. Ascetic can be a noun: a person with incredible self-discipline and the ability to deprive herself, or an adjective that describes such a people or their lifestyle.", "MEANING: verb.- expel, as if by official decreeverb.- refer to another person for decision or judgmentverb.- assign to a class or kindverb.- assign to a lower position; reduce in rank SENTENCE: Relegate means \"to assign to a lower position.\" If the quarterback of the football team stops making decent throws, he might be relegated to the position of benchwarmer. MNEMONIC: Relegate rhymes with delegate \u2014 both words derive from the Latin legare, \"to send.\" Relegate means to send someone down in rank. Delegate means to send someone in your place to complete a task. In the workplace, managers who can't figure out how to delegate may get relegated to a lesser rank.", "MEANING: verb.- cause (a chemical compound, vapour, solution, magnetic material) to unite with the greatest possible amount of another substanceverb.- infuse or fill completely SENTENCE: The verb saturate means to cause something to be fully soaked to the point where it can't take on anything else. A heavy rainstorm can saturate the ground, leaving puddles on the lawn because no more water can be absorbed. MNEMONIC: The word saturate comes from the Latin word saturatus, meaning \"to fill full, sate, drench.\" Saturate is often used to describe the aftermath of a big rainstorm, but other things can be saturated as well. If you're a workaholic, you might saturate all your free time with work, leaving no time to spend with your family. In chemistry, saturate describes causing one substance, like a solution, to take on the greatest amount of another substance.", "MEANING: adjective.- brought low in spirit SENTENCE: If you are crestfallen, you are dark, depressed, and down in the dumps. You are in need of a pep talk, or at least a hug. MNEMONIC: Although experts can't agree on the origins of crestfallen, they do know it has something to do with fallen or defeated animals. Some say it is cocks, with their crested heads, that are responsible for the words' origins. Others think it has to do with horses bowing their heads (touching their heads to the crest of their chests) when bested in battle. No matter which animal gave us the word, today's humans are crestfallen when they are in low spirits.", "MEANING: adjective.- not following logically as a consequenceadjective.- lacking worth or importance SENTENCE: If something is considered of little worth or importance, it is inconsequential. If astronomers forecast a tremendous meteor shower, it might turn out to be no more than space junk, too inconsequential to record. MNEMONIC: You can use the adjective inconsequential to describe things that just don\u2019t matter or are of no relevance, as in \"the rainy forecast is totally inconsequential \u2014 the bowling tournament is inside!\" It also describes things that don't make sense in a certain order, \"trying to win their votes is inconsequential: the election's over.\" Something small or minor can be inconsequential too, though the red bump on your nose on picture-day may not seem as inconsequential to you as it does to the photographer.", "MEANING: adjective.- causing irritation or annoyance SENTENCE: Something that's galling is frustrating or exasperating. A galling argument with your parents leaves you irritated and indignant. MNEMONIC: Galling things make you angry. It would be galling to lose your job because of someone else's mistake, and it's galling to see some members of society being treated unfairly and feeling helpless to do anything about it. An article with a galling viewpoint makes you fume. Galling comes from the verb gall, which means \"annoy,\" but originally was \"chafe or rub until sore.\"", "MEANING: noun.- thunderous verbal attack SENTENCE: It's pretty overwhelming when you ask your friend a seemingly innocuous question, like \"Do you like hot dogs?\" and she unleashes a diatribe about the evils of eating meat. A diatribe is an angry, critical speech. MNEMONIC: This noun has its roots in the Greek diatrib\u0113, \"pastime or lecture,\" from diatr\u012bbein, \"to waste time or wear away,\" combining dia-, \"thoroughly,\" and tr\u012bbein, \"to rub.\" So the origin of the word diatribe is connected to both serious study and the spending or wasting of time. With most diatribes, the speaker thinks he's well informed and knows something the listener doesn't, while to most listeners the diatribe is so angry and unhinged that it's just a waste of time.", "MEANING: adjective.- stubbornly insistent on theory without regard for practicality or suitabilitynoun.- a stubborn person of arbitrary or arrogant opinions SENTENCE: You've doubtless met someone doctrinaire at some point. You know them by their complete unwillingness to accept any belief other than their own. MNEMONIC: If you're familiar with the noun \"doctrine\" \u2014 a formal idea or system of belief \u2014 you'll have no problem with the adjective doctrinaire. It's a just a way of describing a person or group of people who are set in their ways. Parents can start out doctrinaire, but children soon force them to be flexible in how they bring them up.", "MEANING: adjective.- disposed to believe on little evidenceadjective.- showing a lack of judgment or experience SENTENCE: People who believe things easily without having to be convinced are credulous. Sales people are always hoping that someone credulous picks up the phone during a sales call. MNEMONIC: Credulous comes from the 16th-century Latin credulus, or \"easily believes.\" A synonym for credulous is gullible, and both terms describe a person who accepts something willingly without a lot of supporting facts. Calling someone credulous can imply that the person is naive and simple. An individual isn't necessarily insulted by being called credulous, though, because some objects of belief, like religions and unicorns, come with a willing leap of faith for believing in what is unseen.", "MEANING: adjective.- deliberately impassive in manneradjective.- having or revealing little emotion or sensibility; not easily aroused or excited SENTENCE: Someone who doesn't seem to react \u2014 who is always \"taking a pass\" in the conversation of life can be described as impassive. MNEMONIC: Impassive is tricky, as it sounds it should be the opposite of passive. It's not, though. The fact is you can be passive and impassive at the same time. When a passive person gets passed over for a promotion at work, their face might remain impassive upon hearing the news.", "MEANING: noun.- a speech of violent denunciation SENTENCE: A tirade is a speech, usually consisting of a long string of violent, emotionally charged words. Borrow and lose your roommate\u2019s clothes one too many times, and you can bet you\u2019ll be treated to a heated tirade. MNEMONIC: The noun tirade is related to the Italian word tirata, which means \"volley.\" So imagine a very angry person lobbing harsh words and strings of profanity in your direction when you want to remember what  tirade means. Although, tirades don't necessarily have to include bad words \u2014 any long, drawn out speech or epic declaration can be called a tirade.", "MEANING: adjective.- having only a limited ability to react chemically; chemically inactiveadjective.- slow and apatheticadjective.- unable to move or resist motion SENTENCE: Something that's unable to move or moving without much energy can be described as inert. Wind up in a body cast and you\u2019ll find yourself not only itchy, but totally inert. MNEMONIC: When motion is restricted or sluggish, or when something or someone appears lifeless, the adjective to use is inert. A dog who's playing dead is inert, as is a really boring movie. Or for those of you paying attention in chemistry class, you may have heard of inert gases \u2014 those elements that won't react with other elements or form chemical compounds.", "MEANING: noun.- a score in tenpins; knocking down all ten after rolling two ballsverb.- save or relieve from an experience or actionverb.- refrain from harmingadjective.- thin and fitadjective.- lacking embellishment or ornamentationadjective.- lacking in amplitude or quantityverb.- use frugally or carefullyverb.- give up what is not strictly needednoun.- an extra car wheel and tire for a four-wheel vehiclenoun.- an extra component of a machine or other apparatusadjective.- kept in reserve especially for emergency useadjective.- not taken up by scheduled activitiesadjective.- more than is needed, desired, or required SENTENCE: Spare describes something that is extra. If you have a spare tire for your bike you can replace a flat, and if there's enough change in your pocket you can spare some to patch a friend's tire. MNEMONIC: As a noun, a verb, and an adjective, the word spare has many meanings. A leftover part is a spare, you can spare a life when you save an animal or person, and you have spare time when you finish a project early. If you \"spare no expense\" you spend lots of money and when you spare a friend's feelings, you keep upsetting details to yourself. And if you have a moment to spare, you have time to share.", "MEANING: adj.- moderate; economical.verb.- give (something of which one has enough) to (someone); afford to give to.verb.-  refrain from killing, injuring, or distressing.SENTENCE: adj.- It was furnished in a sparing and comfortable manner.verb.- You have all this money and you won't spare enough to let your own child go back homeverb.- I hoped that the rain would spare me at least until the time I reached that spot.MNEMONIC: spare parts are parts that you lend to fix a damaged robot", "MEANING: adj.- merciless; severe.adj. given freely and generously.SENTENCE:  - A huge mass of material has been organised into a clear, coherent narrative; it is well balanced between the serious politics and the intimate detail and is unsparing in its gruesome factual account of what it was like to be there.- Time and again, in prose unsparing and unsentimental, Liz has allowed readers a peek into her own mental health strugglesMNEMONIC:  (despiadado) ", "MEANING: adjective.- not making concessions SENTENCE: Someone who's uncompromising stubbornly refuses to change their opinions or accommodate other people's ideas. Your mom's uncompromising prohibition on snacks in the living room may keep some friends away from your movie nights. MNEMONIC: If you're uncompromising, you don't compromise, or meet people halfway, making some concessions to what they want. Sometimes this is a sign of power and dedication: \"Her uncompromising focus on civil rights helped the movement's advance.\" It can also be evidence of inflexibility and stubbornness: \"The President's uncompromising style resulted in many vetoes and little progress.\"", "MEANING: Very Disciplined, Living Simplyadj.- unsparing and uncompromising in discipline or judgmentadj.- practicing great self-denialadj.- resolute in the face of pain or danger or adversitySENTENCE: Her Apartment Was So Spartan That She Couldn'T Even Serve Us Both Soups; She Only Had One Bowl And One Spoon.MNEMONIC: In Movie 300, We Saw Story About Ancient Greek Spartans; Although This Movie Wasn'T Historically Accurate, Yet It Was Know That The Spartans Were Fierce Wardiors Known For Their Harsh Training Methods.", "MEANING: noun.- a state of guilt SENTENCE: Culpability is a state of guilt or responsibility. A lot of lawsuits are about who has culpability for something that went wrong. MNEMONIC: Culpability is a fancy-sounding word, but it's a simple concept: guilt. You have culpability if you're responsible for something, usually something bad. If you left the door open and your house was robbed, you have some culpability (not as much as the robber, though). If a store owner doesn't salt the ice on the sidewalk and you slip, he has some culpability if you get injured. Figuring out culpability is about figuring out who's to blame.", "MEANING: adjective.- spreading or spread throughout SENTENCE: When something is pervasive, it's everywhere. Common things are pervasive \u2014 like greed and cheap perfume. MNEMONIC: Ever notice how certain trends seem to spread all over the place? When something \u2014 like a hairstyle \u2014 is super-common, it's pervasive. Pervasive things can't be escaped. Playing video games is pervasive among kids. Talking about the weather is pervasive among adults. Ideas, diseases, habits, and all sorts of things can be pervasive. If you're sick of seeing something because you're seeing it again and again, it must be pervasive.", "MEANING: adjective.- marked by lack of intellectual depthadjective.- having only superficial plausibilityadjective.- artfully persuasive in speech SENTENCE: A hiring manager might think you're being glib, or slick and insincere, if you say you've led a successful multinational corporation when you were actually in charge of flipping burgers for a fast-food restaurant chain. MNEMONIC: The word glib might be used to describe the slick car salesman who uses his polished sales pitch to talk his customers into buying lemons. In fact, the word comes from old German and Dutch words for \"slippery,\" another word that could be used to describe the very same salesman. In addition to meaning \"smooth\" and \"persuasive,\" glib can be applied to the kind of thoughtless comment that could get you into big trouble. Telling your boss that you had a \"hot time\" with his daughter is the kind of glib remark that could end your career.", "MEANING: capable of being measured by a common standardadj .- measurable by the same standard.adj.- proportionate to.adj.- (of numbers) in a ratio equal to a ratio of integers.SENTENCE: adj.- Other than value counted in units of money, there's no commensurable way of talking about it.adj.- The service of the members of the Committee is commensurable to the service of the Board of Directorsadj.- In this he discussed whether the celestial motions are commensurable or, expressed another way, is there a basic time interval so that the day, month, and year are all exact integer multiples of itMNEMONIC com (with) mensurable (the same measure)", "MEANING: adjective.- corresponding in size or degree or extent SENTENCE: The word commensurate has to do with things that are similar in size and therefore appropriate. Many people think the death penalty is a commensurate punishment for murder. In other words, the penalty fits the crime. MNEMONIC: When things are commensurate, they're fair, appropriate, and the right size. If you got a ticket for jaywalking, you shouldn't get ten years in prison \u2014 that penalty is not commensurate with the crime. The word commensurate is usually followed by with or to; one thing is commensurate with or to another.", "MEANING: noun.- a strong liking SENTENCE: A penchant is a strong preference or tendency. If you have a penchant for pizza, you either eat it daily or wish you did. MNEMONIC: Penchant borrows from French, in which penchant literally means inclined. It goes back to the Latin pendere, for hanging, which is also the source of pendant. In both French and English, speakers have long used the idea of inclination metaphorically: a hillside can be inclined in one direction or another, and so can a person's thoughts. But in English, penchant is only for desires.", "MEANING: noun.- inactivity resulting from lethargy and lack of vigor or energynoun.- a state of motor and mental inactivity with a partial suspension of sensibility SENTENCE: Torpor is a state of mental and physical inactivity. \"After a huge Thanksgiving meal, my family members fall into a torpor; no one can even pick up the TV remote.\" MNEMONIC: Torpor can be used in everyday speech, but it's also a scientific term for a state of deep sleep that allows animals to conserve energy. Certain species of bats, birds, and frogs rely on torpor for survival during tough times. While humans don't technically belong to this group of animals, they certainly appear to, especially after a large meal and on most Monday mornings.", "MEANING: noun.- someone who dislikes people in general SENTENCE: A misanthrope is a person who hates or mistrusts other people. Your great aunt Edna who lashes out at anyone who approaches, convinced they'll steal the jewelry she keeps in her handbag on her lap? A misanthrope indeed. MNEMONIC: This is a formal word, derived from Greek misanthr\u014dpos \"hating mankind,\" from misein \"to hate\" plus anthr\u014dpos \"a man.\" From the same root, we get the English word anthropology \"the study of humans.\" If you make a statement or do something that is particularly hostile or untrusting, you can call that misanthropic.", "MEANING: adjective.- extremely hotadjective.- emotionally charged and vigorously energeticadjective.- characterized by intense emotion SENTENCE: If you\u2019re having a torrid romance, that means it's steamy and emotionally charged. If you\u2019re listening to a torrid band, then you\u2019re listening to a band that has a lot of energy. MNEMONIC: Torrid is an adjective that describes something that's extremely hot \u2014 in both the literal and the figurative senses. It also describes something that's very energetic, or something that has an extreme emotional charge \u2014 which is why people often apply torrid to love affairs. Torrid comes from the Latin word torrere, meaning \u201cparch or scorch.\u201d Being scorched can sometimes be exciting, but when you\u2019re parched, you need water \u2014 and maybe a break from dating.", "MEANING: adjective.- having no intrinsic or objective meaning; not organized in conventional patternsadjective.- open to two or more interpretations; or of uncertain nature or significance; or (often) intended to misleadadjective.- having more than one possible meaning SENTENCE: Look to the adjective ambiguous when you need to describe something that's open to more than one interpretation, like the headline \"Squad helps dog bite victim.\" MNEMONIC: Newspaper headlines can be unintentionally funny when they're ambiguous. In \"Squad helps dog bite victim,\" is the squad helping a victim of a dog bite or helping a dog bite a victim?  The ambi- prefix means \"both ways,\" while the guous part is from the Latin verb agere, \"to lead or drive.\" Thus an ambiguous sentence or situation drives us in two different directions at once. The accent is on the second syllable, \"big,\" which you can remember since something that's ambiguous can lead to big misunderstandings.", "MEANING: noun.- lack of self-confidence SENTENCE: The noun diffidence refers to a lack of self-confidence. Your diffidence might be the reason why you never say \"hi\" to the cute guy or gal in the elevator or why you never ask for a raise. MNEMONIC: The noun diffidence comes from the Latin word diffidere, meaning \"to mistrust\" or \"to lack confidence.\" Diffidence is often mistaken for snootiness because people don't understand that the diffident person is shy and lacking in confidence. \"They asked him to be the team leader, but he expressed diffidence, saying that he didn't think he had enough time to do the job justice, nor did he think he had enough experience.\"", "MEANING: verb.- make less severe or harshverb.- lessen or to try to lessen the seriousness or extent of SENTENCE: Choose the verb mitigate when something lessens the unpleasantness of a situation. You can mitigate your parents' anger by telling them you were late to dinner because you were helping your elderly neighbor. MNEMONIC: The somewhat formal verb mitigate comes from the Latin roots m\u012btis \"soft\" and agere \"to do/act,\" which add up to \"to soften.\" It is often used with words that indicate an outcome or something harmful. When you buy car insurance, you are trying to mitigate the risks involved with driving. Sunscreen is used to mitigate the effects of the sun on your skin.", "MEANING: verb.- make childrenverb.- call forth SENTENCE: Engender is a fancy way of saying \"to make happen,\" like when you engender the spirit of teamwork and cooperation by encouraging others and doing your share of the group's work. MNEMONIC: The verb engender has nothing to do with being male or female, though originally, it did mean \"beget, procreate.\" Today, engender means \"to produce or bring about.\" When students come to class prepared, meaning they've read their assignment, this engenders better class discussions, just as mutual trust and the desire to help each other engenders a meaningful friendship.", "MEANING: adjective.- (heraldry) lying with head on paws as if sleepingadjective.- (of e.g. volcanos) not erupting and not extinctadjective.- in a condition of biological rest or suspended animationadjective.- inactive but capable of becoming active SENTENCE: That old dog was dormant for so long he was confused for a furry doormat, but a doormat is likely to stay dormant, or inactive, because it is lifeless: that old dog has some life in him yet. MNEMONIC: Volcanoes are described as dormant when they stay cool for a long time, without spewing hot lava and ash. They may have the ability to come to life, but they remain dormant, or inactive. Dormant comes from French dormir, \"to sleep,\" and it refers to living things that are on a break rather than things that have died. Being dormant is being temporarily at rest, although sometimes, as with some cancer cells, things become permanently \u2014 and thankfully \u2014 dormant.", "MEANING: Talking A Lot In An Energetic Way.marked by a ready flow of speechVoluble describes someone who talks a lot, like your aunt who can\u2019t stop telling you to cut your hair or a political candidate who makes twenty speeches on the day before the election.SENTENCE: The Volubility In His Expression Shows His Level Of Knowledge In The Topic.MNEMONIC: Have you ever found it especially hard to interrupt someone who talks a lot when he or she gets on a roll? If so, it won\u2019t surprise you that the adjective voluble traces back to the Latin word volvere, meaning \u201cto roll.\u201d The word voluble describes talking continuously, fluently, at great length, in a steady flow. You\u2019ll know it when you meet voluble talkers: they just keep rolling on and on.", "MEANING: noun.- a formal reception of visitors or guests (as at a royal court)noun.- a pier that provides a landing place on a rivernoun.- an embankment that is built in order to prevent a river from overflowing SENTENCE: A levee is an embankment, like a dam, constructed to prevent the overflow of a body of water. It can also mean a formal reception. How do these two words relate? Read on... MNEMONIC: In French, lever means to lift and se lever means to rise, literally \"lift yourself.\" When the king rose from his bed and received visitors, that was a levee. When you raise up dirt or other materials to build a dam or levee, that's also a levee. Now, official levees don't involve kings\u2013\u2013but you might hear of \u201ca governor\u2019s levee at the state capital.\u201d And levee can be used as a verb, meaning to make an embankment, or shore up.", "MEANING: adjective.- constituting an imitationnoun.- someone who mimics (especially an actor or actress)verb.- imitate (a person or manner), especially for satirical effect SENTENCE: A mimic is someone who is good at imitating others. A gifted mimic might be able to imitate one president after another just by minimally changing facial expression and manner of speaking. MNEMONIC: Mimic, related to mime, an entertainer who performs using gestures not speech, can be traced back to the Greek mimeisthai \"to imitate.\" Usually when you mimic someone, you imitate them in order to make fun of them. Performers mimic famous people to get laughs, but ordinary people mimic others when they are angry at them. Who hasn't mimicked parents or a boss who has said no one too many times?!", "MEANING: noun.- the property of being physically malleable; the property of something that can be worked or hammered or shaped without breaking SENTENCE: Plasticity means \"changeability\" or \"moldability\" \u2014 clay has a lot of plasticity, but a rock has almost none. MNEMONIC: It helps to think of plastic when learning what plasticity means. See how plastic can be molded into all sorts of things, and even when it's in a totally solid form, it's not hard like stone? Plasticity refers to things that can still change their shape or function. The brain is something with high plasticity: if you have a brain injury, other parts of the brain can change to pick up the slack. Anything that is capable of evolving or being reshaped has plasticity.", "MEANING: adjective.- constituting a separate entity or part SENTENCE: Discrete means separate or divided. A discrete unit is a separate part of something larger. A room is a discrete space within a house, just as the crankshaft is a discrete part of a car engine. MNEMONIC: If something is discrete, it has its own space. An ice cube comes from an ice tray, but it has its own discrete compartment. A student government might have discrete committees for different projects. Don't confuse discrete with its close cousin discreet, which means \u201cappropriately private.\u201d Billionaire Bruce Wayne, for example, is very discreet about his secret life as Batman. You could say Batman is a discrete, or separate, part of Bruce Wayne\u2019s identity. Anything distinct and separated is discrete.", "MEANING: verb.- give or assign a resource to a particular person or causeverb.- take possession of by force, as after an invasionadjective.- suitable for a particular person, place, condition, etc. SENTENCE: Something appropriate is correct and fits the situation. A sweater-vest with reindeer on it is appropriate holiday apparel, even if it's totally embarrassing. MNEMONIC: The adjective appropriate is used when something is suitable or fitting. It comes from the Latin appropriare, which means \"to make something fit, to make something one's own.\" Going back even further, appropriate is related to the Latin word proprius, \"to belong to a person, thing, or group.\" Another appropriate way to use this word is as a verb, meaning to steal or seize something, the way you'd appropriate your sister's sandwich if she left it sitting near you.", "MEANING: adjective.- favorable to health of mind or bodyadjective.- promoting health; healthful SENTENCE: Salubrious is a fancy way to describe something that\u2019s good for you or is generally favorable to mind or body, but it need not be limited to describing healthy foods or liquids. MNEMONIC: We salute each other with the cheer, \"To your health!\" as we chug down something that probably isn\u2019t that good for us. But if it were salubrious, it would be. The two words, salute and salubrious stem from the same salus, meaning \"welfare, health.\u201d Maybe next time, raise a glass of wheatgrass instead of vino!", "MEANING: noun.- audacious (even arrogant) behavior that you have no right to SENTENCE: If you rudely behave as if you have a right to something that you have no right to, you're committing effrontery. When a couple stroll into a crowded restaurant, demand the best table, and threaten the staff unless they're seated right away, that's effrontery. MNEMONIC: People have been guilty of outrageously self-centered behavior at least since 1715, when effrontery was coined. Tracing to the French word effront\u00e9, meaning \"shameless,\" the word effrontery is also connected to brazen, which means \"of brass,\" and describes someone so accustomed to effrontery that he's hardened to it and has no concern for the harm done to others.", "MEANING: adjective.- lacking taste or flavor or tangadjective.- lacking interest or significance or impact SENTENCE: Something insipid is lacking in flavor or interest. You'll probably find the generic poems inside of greeting cards insipid. MNEMONIC: Insipid comes from the Latin insipidus, the opposite of sapidus which means flavorful. Because spices and salts are left out, hospital food is usually considered insipid. The most common use of the word is in a metaphorical sense for dull or flat. You might think that your goody-two-shoes cousin is the most insipid girl you've ever met.", "MEANING: adjective.- habitually reserved and uncommunicative SENTENCE: Someone who is taciturn is reserved, not loud and talkative. The word itself refers to the trait of reticence, of seeming aloof and uncommunicative. A taciturn person might be snobby, naturally quiet, or just shy. MNEMONIC: Having its origin in the Latin tacitus, \"silent,\" taciturn came to be used in mid-18th-century English in the sense \"habitually silent.\" Taciturnity is often considered a negative trait, as it suggests someone uncommunicative and too quiet. Jane Austen wrote, \"We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the \u00e9clat of a proverb.\"", "MEANING: adverb.- in an aloof manneradjective.- remote in manner SENTENCE: Someone who's aloof isn't warm and friendly, instead being distant and reserved. That emotionally cold and detached fellow who keeps to himself, drinking espresso and reading French philosophy, would best be described as aloof. MNEMONIC: In Middle English, aloof was originally a nautical term; the loof (now spelled luff) is the windward side of a ship. Smart sailors wanting to avoid a hazard on the leeward side would give the order, \"A loof!\" From this command we get the idea of steering clear of something (or someone). In modern usage the word has taken on a negative connotation: an aloof person is often considered cold or snobby.", "MEANING: noun.- the quality of disagreeing; being unsuitable and inappropriate SENTENCE: Incongruity means out of place \u2014 something that doesn't fit in its location or situation. The art show patrons couldn't help but chuckle at the incongruity of a toilet sitting in the middle of an exhibition of Renaissance paintings. MNEMONIC: An incongruity is very different from everything around it, to the point of being inappropriate to the situation. A cat at a dog's birthday party would be an incongruity, as would a pacifist at a meeting of the War Lovers' Society. Incongruity is the idea that something is incongruous, or inappropriate. A purple towel is an incongruity in an all black-and-white bathroom.", "MEANING: adjective.- befitting or characteristic of those who incline to social exclusiveness and who rebuff the advances of people considered inferior SENTENCE: Snobby people think they're better than others. A snobby club might only allow members who dress a certain way or attend a certain school, excluding everyone else. MNEMONIC: Some snobby people are wealthy and believe that those who have less are inferior, while other snobby folks are smart and well-educated, and look down on people who are uneducated. Snobby is an informal word that describes a snob, which originally meant \"a shoemaker or a shoemaker's apprentice.\" From that meaning it evolved through \"lowly person\" to \"lowly person imitating a social superior\" and finally \"person who despises those considered inferior.\"", "MEANING: verb.- reject with contemptverb.- look down on with disdainnoun.- open disrespect for a person or thingnoun.- lack of respect accompanied by a feeling of intense dislike SENTENCE: Scorn is open disrespect for someone or something. It can also be disrespect coupled with feelings of intense dislike. MNEMONIC: The noun scorn describes your feelings of disdain when you encounter something you view as worthless or inferior \u2014 like, for instance, a talk show that gets all its facts wrong. Use the verb form for those times when you\u2019re actively expressing scorn. You might scorn a politician who spends $100,000 on travel while claiming to work hard promoting middle-class values.", "MEANING: verb.- laugh at with contempt and derisionverb.- treat with contemptuous disregard SENTENCE: To flout is to scorn or show contempt for. \"I flout the law and the concept of civilian safety by making a concerted effort to jaywalk every time I cross a street.\" MNEMONIC: Oddly enough, when flout came into existence in the 1550s, it had a much different sense to it than it does now; it's believed that it evolved from the Middle English flowten, \u201cto play the flute.\" These days, the verb flout means \"to scorn,\" as in to scorn a law, person, or social norm by defying it. As a noun, it is a contemptuous remark or insult. Wrote William Shakespeare, \u201cFlout 'em, and scout 'em; and scout 'em and flout 'em; Thought is free.\u201d", "MEANING: noun.- someone who selects according to the eclectic methodadjective.- selecting what seems best of various styles or ideas SENTENCE: She listens to hip-hop, Gregorian chant, and folk music from the '60s. He's been seen wearing a handmade tuxedo jacket over a thrift-store flannel shirt. They both have eclectic tastes. MNEMONIC: The English word eclectic first appeared in the seventeenth century to describe philosophers who did not belong to a particular school of thought, but instead assembled their doctrines by picking and choosing from a variety of philosophical systems. Today, the word can refer to any assemblage of varied parts. You can have an eclectic group of friends (friends from diverse groups), eclectic taste in furniture (a mixture of 18th-century French chairs, Andy Warhol paintings, and Persian rugs), or enjoy eclectic cuisine (fusion cooking that uses ingredients from different national cuisines).", "MEANING: noun.- a person who is tricked or swindledverb.- fool or hoax SENTENCE: A dupe is a furry, ceremonial hat worn during ancient pagan rituals...or not. Dupe actually means \u201ctrick or deceive.\u201d We\u2019re sorry we tried to dupe you into believing the wrong definition. MNEMONIC: Dupe can also refer to the victim of a trick or hoax, and \u2014 used in this sense \u2014 it sometimes conveys the idea that the victim is easily fooled. Dupe comes from the French word for a type of bird called the hoopoe, which has an extravagant crest and a reputation for being dim-witted. (And no, that's not another attempt to dupe you; it's the truth!)", "MEANING: adjective.- having complicated nutritional requirements; especially growing only in special artificial culturesadjective.- giving careful attention to detail; hard to please; excessively concerned with cleanliness SENTENCE: If you want to describe a person who insists on perfection or pays much attention to food, clothing and cleanliness, the right word is fastidious. MNEMONIC: Fastidious is a funny-sounding adjective from the Latin fastidium \"loathing\" that has several equally strange-sounding synonyms \u2014 persnickety, fussbudgety, finicky and punctilious. Fussy and hard to please will also do the trick. Fastidious is occasionally used as a compliment to describe someone whose attention to detail gives them good organizing abilities, but it is usually used as a disapproving term.", "MEANING: adjective.- cleverly amusing in tone SENTENCE: Don\u2019t take a facetious comment seriously because it\u2019s supposed to be funny. Anything facetious is a joke. If you've just won a hotdog-eating contest and someone asks if you'd like to go out for burgers, they\u2019re probably being facetious. MNEMONIC: If you forget how to spell facetious, notice that it has all five vowels in a row. The word facetious comes from the French fac\u00e9tie, \u201cjoke,\u201d and it has come to describe a joke with a little drop of sarcasm. It used to simply mean \u201cfunny and witty,\u201d but now it often implies that someone is being inappropriately funny about a serious topic.", "MEANING: verb.- cause to become widely knownverb.- spread or diffuse throughverb.- move outwardadjective.- (of light) transmitted from a broad light source or reflectedadjective.- lacking concisenessadjective.- spread out; not concentrated in one place SENTENCE: Diffuse means to spread out. Candlelight can diffuse a soft glow throughout a room. A diffuse idea is one that spreads from person to person, and a diffuse speech is scattered and unclear. MNEMONIC: As a verb, diffuse means to spread something out, but also applies to spreading things such as ideas or culture so that they become widely known. When something is diffused, it's mixed in, and when you drop propaganda pamphlets out of airplanes you're diffusing the propaganda. The adjective comes from Latin diffusus, from diffundere \"to pour in different directions,\" from the prefix dis- \"apart\" plus fundere, \"to pour.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- joyously unrestrained SENTENCE: More than chipper, more than happy, more than delighted is ebullient \u2014 meaning bubbling over with joy and delight. MNEMONIC: There are two senses of the word of ebullient. One describes an immediate, and ultimately short-lived, reaction to a particular event \u2014 for example if you've just won the lottery, you are ebullient. The other describes someone who is perpetually upbeat and cheerful, for example, as in \"an ebullient personality.\" Watch out for ebullient personalities: they can often be \"over the top\" as well.", "MEANING: adjective.- incapable of being placated SENTENCE: An implacable person just can\u2019t be appeased. If you really offended your best friend and tried every kind of apology but she refused to speak to you again, you could describe her as implacable. MNEMONIC: Implacable is derived from the verb to placate, which means to soothe, or to appease. If you\u2019re babysitting and the kid starts screaming the moment that his parents leave the house, and nothing you give him, be it a toy or ice cream, can calm him down, he might seem implacable. But try the TV. It tends to turn screaming kids into silent, happy zombies.", "MEANING: adjective.- able to absorb fluidsadjective.- allowing passage in and outadjective.- full of pores or vessels or holes SENTENCE: If something is full of tiny holes or openings, you can describe it as porous. A sponge is porous, and if the border between countries is open for anyone to cross easily, it too can be called porous. MNEMONIC: You can see the word pore \u2014 meaning \"a tiny opening\" \u2014 in porous. When potters make a mug, they use special glazes to seal the porous clay, which otherwise would absorb the liquid you put in the mug. This meaning has expanded so porous can describe any barrier that allows easy passage in and out, like the porous border between two countries that allows residents to move easily between them.", "MEANING: adjective.- ill-mannered and coarse and contemptible in behavior or appearance SENTENCE: If your cousin tells revolting jokes, belches, and smells like he spent the winter in a cave, he could be described as boorish \u2014 an adjective used for people with bad manners and a sloppy appearance. MNEMONIC: We almost always use the word boorish for men. This may be because it can be traced back to a 13th century word for \u201cherdsman.\u201d Herdsmen spent a lot of time alone with their sheep, sleeping in tents, and cooking over open fires, so it was no wonder that they didn't have the same refined manners as city folk. If someone offends you by acting boorishly \u2014 say, by cutting you off in traffic \u2014 you could exclaim, \u201cWhat a boor!\u201d  Just don't confuse boor with bore: bad manners may be offensive, but they're rarely boring.", "MEANING: noun.- a formal expression of praisenoun.- a formal expression of praise for someone who has died recently SENTENCE: At every funeral, there comes a moment when someone speaks about the life of the person who died. The speaker is delivering what is known as a eulogy. A eulogy is a formal speech that praises a person who has died. MNEMONIC: Usually a eulogy makes the dead person sound a lot more impressive than they really were. A couple of less common synonyms for this kind of \"praise the dead\" speech are panegyric and encomium. Sometimes the dead person was so unimpressive that there's nothing nice to say. And sometimes they were so awful that the only appropriate speech is a dyslogy that describes their faults and failings.", "MEANING: noun.- smallest American sandpipernoun.- an individual's prescribed share of worknoun.- an unbroken period of time during which you do somethingverb.- subsist on a meager allowanceverb.- supply sparingly and with restricted quantities SENTENCE: The noun stint means a set amount of time in which you do something \u2014 often work of some sort. \"She served a stint in the army, followed by a stint in an office setting, before settling on a career as a lounge singer.\" MNEMONIC: Unlike a project or vocation, a stint can refer to the stretch of time spent doing a particular job. You apply for a job, but you refer to your past stint in the Peace Corps. As a verb, stint means to be sparing or frugal, or restrict in a stingy manner (\"to skimp\"). \"The school board chose to make cuts at the administrative level, rather than stint on the children's education.\"", "MEANING: verb.- cause to lose courage SENTENCE: Daunt means to frighten or scare off. The Cowardly Lion's efforts to daunt Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Man were less than successful. MNEMONIC: Daunt rhymes with haunt, another word which means to frighten, though in a creepier sense. Walking through your neighbors' haunted house on Halloween might daunt your little brother, even though he's unlikely to encounter anything scarier than plastic skeletons and ghosts made of sheets. Daunt often shows up as part of the adjective undaunted, which describes someone who remains unafraid or perseveres in the face of scary circumstances.", "MEANING: adjective.- discouraging through fear SENTENCE: Something daunting can scare you off. If you have a lot of studying to do, it may seem like a daunting task. Good news is you can get through it by working hard. Or weasel out of it by playing sick. MNEMONIC: Often used in the phrases \u201cdaunting prospect\u201d and \u201cdaunting task,\u201d daunting describes something that you are not looking forward to doing. Having to fill out complicated tax forms every year is a daunting task for many people. Once a daunting task is complete, you no longer describe it as daunting, but instead can call it a job well done, or at least another life experience survived.", "MEANING: adjective.- generous and understanding and tolerantadjective.- noble and generous in spirit SENTENCE: A magnanimous person has a generous spirit. Letting your little sister have the last of the cookies, even though you hadn't eaten since breakfast, would be considered a magnanimous act. MNEMONIC: Magnanimous comes from Latin magnus \"great\" and animus \"soul,\" so it literally describes someone who is big-hearted. A person can show that over-sized spirit by being noble or brave, or by easily forgiving others and not showing resentment.  It implies superiority, and is something you should say of others rather than of yourself. Being magnanimous doesn't require doling out tons of cash \u2014 just being an understanding and tolerant soul will do the trick.", "MEANING: noun.- liberality in bestowing gifts; extremely liberal and generous of spirit SENTENCE: Magnanimous behavior is noble, generous, or unselfish, and to exhibit magnanimity is to be this way. He showed great magnanimity in not pressing charges when I drove his car into the pond. \"Accidents happen my friend,\" he said, and patted me on the back. MNEMONIC: In Latin, magnus means \"great\": a magnate is a great man; a magnum is a great big bottle of champagne. Magnanimity is the generous greatness of spirit. When you are being the bigger person, you are behaving with magnanimity.  \"The supermodel grabbed the magnum of champagne, lifted it to her mouth and drained the bottle. With great magnanimity, her host smiled and offered her another.\"", "MEANING: verb.- deliver a harangue to; address forcefullynoun.- a loud bombastic declamation expressed with strong emotion SENTENCE: A harangue is more than a speech, louder than a discussion, and nastier than a lecture. It is a verbal attack that doesn't let up, delivered as a verb or received as a noun. Either way, it's pretty unpleasant. MNEMONIC: The word harangue developed its modern spelling around 1530, when the word was recorded as harangue in French. The word, meaning a strong, nasty rant, appears to have evolved from the Old Italian word aringa, probably from the word for a public square or place for public speaking. This in turn appears to have evolved from a Germanic word related to ring, as in \"circular gathering,\" which is clearly similar to the Italian meaning.", "MEANING: noun.- religious zeal; the willingness to serve Godnoun.- the worship of idols; the worship of images that are not God SENTENCE: Idolatry means the worship of images as if they were gods. Many religions prohibit idolatry, some even to the extent of forbidding any representational objects in houses of worship. MNEMONIC: Idol sits at the head of the word idolatry. If you worship \u2014 or even just look up to \u2014 a person or a thing, you are said to idolize them. For some modern idolaters, money is their idol, while for others it is celebrities, and for still others their jobs.", "MEANING: noun.- a person who brings an action in a court of law SENTENCE: In a courtroom, the plaintiff is the person or group who is accusing another person or group of some wrongdoing. If you\u2019re the plaintiff, you are claiming that a law was broken, and you\u2019re in court to present your case. MNEMONIC: The plaintiff accuses, the defendant tries to prove that accusation wrong.  You\u2019ve seen this relationship on television shows about lawyers, or maybe you\u2019ve been to court yourself.  The Old French root word translates as \u201ccomplain\u201d and the Latin root is literally \u201cbeating of the breast,\u201d or explaining your grief in a dramatic way.  Plaintiff shares roots with the adjective plaintive, which describes a sorrowful sound.  The plaintiff made a plaintive cry when the defendant was declared not guilty.", "MEANING: noun.- (law) a pleading by the defendant in reply to a plaintiff's surrejoindernoun.- the speech act of refuting by offering a contrary contention or argument SENTENCE: When two people debate, one of them makes an argument, and the other follows with a rebuttal, which, plainly put, is the \"no, you're wrong and this is why\" argument. MNEMONIC: We often associate rebuttals with arguments made in the courtroom or public debates that occur around election time, but the word can really apply to any situation in which an argument is put forth and someone disagrees, and explains why. Sports fans, for instance, like to argue about the likely winner of an upcoming game and when you make a case for why your friend is wrong, you are offering a rebuttal of his argument.", "MEANING: adjective.- fraught with dangeradjective.- affording no ease or reassuranceadjective.- not secure; beset with difficulties SENTENCE: Grab for the adjective precarious when something is unstable, dangerous or difficult and likely to get worse. Are you totally broke and the people you owe money to keep calling? You're in a precarious financial situation! MNEMONIC: The Latin root of precarious means \"obtained by asking or praying.\" This fits well as precarious always signals that help is needed desperately. If your life is precarious or you are in a precarious situation, things could become difficult, maybe even dangerous, for you. If your footing or hold on something is precarious, it is unstable or not firmly placed, so that you are likely to slip or lose your grip.", "MEANING: adverb.- in a precarious manner SENTENCE: If something is happening or positioned precariously, it's in danger. A glass could be precariously balanced on the edge of a table. MNEMONIC: If something is on the verge of danger, then the word precariously fits. You're living precariously if you jump up and down on a lake that's not totally frozen. In your late teens, you're precariously close to the brink of adulthood. When you have one college class left, you're precariously close to having to find a job. Some people like living precariously: they enjoy danger. Other people just get stressed out and prefer to live carefully.", "MEANING: verb.- decorate or cover lavishly (as with gems)verb.- annoy continually or chronicallyverb.- assail or attack on all sides SENTENCE: Beset means to attack from all sides \u2014 an invading army will beset a castle, or you might find yourself beset by a devastating storm. MNEMONIC: Beset also has a very different meaning: to decorate or encrust with jewels or other ornamentation. If you are attending a ball, you may choose a gown that is beset with silver sequins, just be careful that you don't end up looking like a giant disco ball.", "MEANING: verb.- launch an attack or assault on; begin hostilities or start warfare withverb.- attack in speech or writingverb.- attack someone physically or emotionally SENTENCE: To assail is to attack or assault \u2014 with throwing stars, fists, words or, less tangibly but just as violently, with troubles or doubts. MNEMONIC: Believe it or not, assail evolved from the ancient Latin word  assilire, which means \"to jump on.\" So picture an attacker jumping on you, throwing punches and maybe some insults, too. Because assail also means to ridicule or heap your worries upon someone. As novelist Charlotte Bronte noted, \u201cConventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last.\u201d Think on that.", "MEANING: adjective.- withdrawn from society; seeking solitudenoun.- one who lives in solitude SENTENCE: A recluse lives alone, works alone, eats alone, and generally stays away from other people. Anti-social old hermits are recluses, as are a lot of students during exam time. MNEMONIC: In the early 13th century, a recluse was a person who shut out the world to go meditate on religious issues. But nowadays recluses can think about whatever they want while they're sitting in solitude \u2014 they're simply people who shy away from social interaction and live secluded lives. Or think of the Brown Recluse spider, who likes to hide out in dark old boots or undisturbed corners of the basement.", "MEANING: verb.- cause to be more favorably inclined; gain the good will ofverb.- satisfy (thirst)verb.- provide physical relief, as from pain SENTENCE: If you assuage an unpleasant feeling, you make it go away. Assuaging your hunger by eating a bag of marshmallows may cause you other unpleasant feelings. MNEMONIC: The most common things that we assuage are fears, concerns, guilt, grief, anxiety, and anger. That makes a lot of sense \u2014 these are all things we seek relief from. The word comes from Old French assouagier, from the Latin root suavis, \"sweet\" \u2014 think of adding a bit of honey to something unpleasant. A word with a similar meaning is mollify.", "MEANING: noun.- a period of calm weathernoun.- a pause during which things are calm or activities are diminishedverb.- become quiet or less intensiveverb.- calm by deceptionverb.- make calm or still SENTENCE: See lull, think \"calm.\" It could be the noun form (like \"the lull before the storm\") or the verb: one can lull someone by calming them (as in lulling a baby to sleep with a lullaby). MNEMONIC: The noun lull is often used in relation to a storm, but the term has a broader meaning as well. Lull can be used to describe any temporary period of calm or diminished activity, like the quiet time before the lunch rush in a restaurant or the brief period of tranquility before the doors open for a pre-Christmas sale. The word's verb form means \"to soothe or to make someone feel relaxed.\" When used as a verb lull can turn deceptive, and it is often used to convey a false sense of security.", "MEANING: noun.- the act of singing a quiet song to lull a child to sleepnoun.- a quiet song intended to lull a child to sleep SENTENCE: If anyone has ever sung a song to you before bedtime, trying to lull you to sleep, you can call that song a lullaby. Lullabies are usually soft and soothing tunes \u2014 more like \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\" than AC/DC's \"Back in Black.\" MNEMONIC: Many lullabies are folk tunes, and most of them are simple melodies with repetitive lyrics. You might be familiar with lullabies like \"Hush, Little Baby,\" \"Rockabye Baby,\" and \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star,\" all of which have been sung for generations to sleepy children by their parents, grandparents, and babysitters. The word lullaby comes from the Middle English lullen, \"to lull or soothe,\" and bye, as in \"bye bye.\"", "MEANING: verb.- pronounce not guilty of criminal charges SENTENCE: To exculpate means to find someone not guilty of criminal charges. If you've been wrongly accused of robbery, you'd better hope a judge will exculpate you, unless you want to go to jail because you've heard prison food is amazing. MNEMONIC: Exculpate comes from two Latin words: ex-, meaning \"from,\" and culpa, meaning \"blame.\" Exculpate is similar in meaning to exonerate. When you exonerate someone, you clear a person of an accusation and any suspicion that goes along with it. Exculpate usually refers more directly to clearing the charges against someone. So if that judge exculpates you from the robbery charge, everyone in town might still think you did it. Get him to exculpate and exonerate you.", "MEANING: verb.- remove (someone's or one's own) clothesverb.- deprive of status or authorityverb.- reduce or dispose of; cease to hold (an investment)verb.- take away possessions from someone SENTENCE: It could be your wine portfolio, your stake in a mining company, or even the extra coats that are taking up space in your closet. Whatever it is, when you divest something, you get rid of it. MNEMONIC: Divest is sort of a fancy way to say \u201cdispose of.\u201d It\u2019s often used in a business context to describe companies or governments that divest some of their holdings by selling them off. It can also be used in the sense of taking something away from someone. For example if your boss becomes insane and power mad, his handlers may divest him of his title, meaning his position is taken away from him.", "MEANING: verb.- swindle; obtain by coercion or intimidationverb.- make a groove inverb.- force with the thumbnoun.- the act of gougingnoun.- and edge tool with a blade like a trough for cutting channels or groovesnoun.- an impression in a surface (as made by a blow) SENTENCE: To gouge can mean to make a hole or dent in something, or to swindle or steal by overcharging. If your local gas station raises prices because a storm is coming, you may say that the station owner is gouging you \u2014 and that's illegal. MNEMONIC: The verb gouge means to cut or carve. You can use special chisels to gouge linoleum for interesting design in printing. As a noun, a gouge is the tool you would use \u2014 instead of a flat-head chisel, a gouge has a trough \u2014 to make the gouge marks of the design. Another meaning of the verb gouge is an indentation in the surface of something. If you're not careful with the screwdriver, you'll accidentally gouge a hole in the wall.", "MEANING: adjective.- having or causing a whirling sensation; liable to fallingadjective.- lacking seriousness; given to frivolity SENTENCE: If you've ever spun in circles until you fell to the ground laughing, you know how it feels to be giddy. This adjective can mean dizzy, elated, or  \u2014 as in the spinning around example \u2014 a lightheaded, lighthearted combination of the two. MNEMONIC: The hackneyed phrase \"giddy as a schoolgirl\" calls forth the image of a kid giggling with her friends over some adolescent foolishness. Giddy has been used to describe someone incapable of serious thought or easily excited as far back as the 16th century. Given that, in modern usage, giddy describes someone silly and frivolous, it's interesting to know that the Old English source for this word has a slightly darker tinge: gidig means \"insane\" or \"god-possessed.\"", "MEANING: noun.- the act of swindling by some fraudulent schemeverb.- deprive of by deceit SENTENCE: To swindle is to cheat or steal. You can swindle money, goods, ideas, and anything else that can be stolen, but be careful, because someone can also swindle you. MNEMONIC: In the late 1700s, the verb swindle formed from swindler, which means \u201cgiddy person, cheat.\u201d Swindle can be a noun or a verb. When you get something by less than honest means, that\u2019s a swindle. A successful act of swindle often involves some scheme or rigging of the system. Hollywood loves a good swindle \u2014 think of all the movies that show a bank robbery or people lying about who they are.  Another funny word for swindle is bamboozle.", "MEANING: verb.- make a groove inverb.- dig with the snoutnoun.- a disorderly crowd of peopleverb.- cause to fleeverb.- defeat disastrouslynoun.- an overwhelming defeat SENTENCE:  MNEMONIC: One way to remember the meaning of the word rout is to consider its similarity to the word riot, both suggesting a disastrous mess. One interesting thing about the word rout is that whether it's used as a noun or as a verb, it's spelled the same and implies a similar meaning. \"The losing team suffers during a rout while the winning team actually routs them!\" Whichever form you use, you're referring to a pretty devastating defeat.", "MEANING: noun.- informal terms for the nosenoun.- beaklike projection of the anterior part of the head of certain insects such as e.g. weevilsnoun.- a long projecting or anterior elongation of an animal's head; especially the nose SENTENCE: An animal's long, protruding nose is often called a snout. The tricky part, though, is that not all long animal noses are called snouts. MNEMONIC: An elephant has a very long nose, but we don't call it a snout, we call it a trunk. A horse's nose is rarely referred to as a snout, because it's really their whole face that's long. Birds have beaks. Most dogs have a snout, except for pugs and boxers and other dogs with smashed-in faces. Bears have snouts, as do rats. Do yourself a favor, though, and never tell a person that they have a snout, no matter how large their nose is.

You'll want to carry tissues or a handkerchief with you when you're sneezing, to keep the snot contained. MNEMONIC: There are two meanings of the noun snot: the first, mucus, can be unpleasant. The second meaning, an irritatingly arrogant person, is also unpleasant. If a little kid acts like a snot, his babysitter is definitely not going to let him stay up past his bedtime.

Snot comes from the Old English word gesnot, or \"nasal mucus,\" from a Germanic root.", "MEANING: noun.- an event or situation that happens at the same time as or in connection with anotheradjective.- following or accompanying as a consequence SENTENCE: Concomitant means accompanying. If you run into someone that you have a crush on, you might feel nervousness with a concomitant forgetfulness. MNEMONIC: Concomitant is one of those Latin-based words you can break down into little pieces: con means with, and comit means companion. So something that is concomitant is like the companion of the main event.

We can only hope they play it well.", "MEANING: verb.- cause to become widely known SENTENCE: Disseminate means to spread information, knowledge, opinions widely. Semin- derives from the Latin word for seed; the idea with disseminate is that information travels like seeds sown by a farmer. MNEMONIC: Think about a teacher distributing a hand out at the beginning of a class. The dis-  of disseminate and distribute come from the same Latin prefix which means \"apart, in a different direction.\" But unlike papers distributed in class, information, once spread around in all directions, cannot be pulled back in. Think about false rumors or political smear campaigns and you'll understand that dissemination is usually a one-way process.", "MEANING: adjective.- capable of being done with means at hand and circumstances as they areadjective.- capable of life or normal growth and development SENTENCE: When something is viable, it has the ability to grow or function properly.

It is made up of the Latin root vita, which means \"life,\" and the ending -able, which means \"to be possible.\" In terms of science or botany, when a plant is viable it can live and flourish in an environment such as a cactus in the desert.

In some cultures and special situations, hammocks have been used for regular sleeping \u2014 for example, hammocks were once commonly found on ships, providing sailors with easily portable beds. Hammock comes from the Spanish hamaca, a variation on the Taino hamaka, \"fish nets.\"", "MEANING: adjective.- having low densityadjective.- of high moral or intellectual value; elevated in nature or style SENTENCE: Use the adjective rarefied to describe things that are so stylish, smart, or moral that they seem elevated above the ordinary, like the rarefied conversation of brilliant scholars.

A three-hour lecture on the history of socks might thrill someone, it would enervate most people. So would a too-long soak in a hot tub. With your parents. MNEMONIC: Trace enervate back far enough and you'll discover that it comes from the Latin enervare which means basically \u201cto cut the sinew\u201d or \u201cto cause to be cut from the muscle.\u201d That would certainly weaken someone. These days, there\u2019s no need for violence. To enervate someone is to sap their energy, like by reading your ex all the love letters your new sweetheart wrote you. When something enervates you, it does more than get on your nerves; it brings you down.", "MEANING: verb.- be a mystery or bewildering toverb.- cause annoyance in; disturb, especially by minor irritationsverb.- cover with gravelnoun.- rock fragments and pebbles SENTENCE: Gravel is very small, irregular pieces of rock and stone. Your gravel driveway might crunch under your boots as you walk to the mailbox.

Gravel is more rough and rocky than sand, and smaller than stones.

You don't have to be a canine though; you might grovel for a better grade (please don't). MNEMONIC: If you grovel you risk getting the opposite of what you want, because people (like teachers) don't like people down at their feet begging for something. But if you cheat on your date, you may have to grovel to get him or her back. Grovel also means to crawl around on your belly \u2014 you could grovel on gravel, but that might really hurt. The word comes from the Vikings; in Old Norse the word grufe means \"prone\" (lying flat) which is probably how Vikings liked to see the people they were conquering.

If you've got a paucity of good cheer, for example, you'd better cheer up! MNEMONIC: One good way to remember the meaning of paucity is that it's a bit like pauper, as in The Prince and the Pauper. The prince had too much money, and the pauper had a paucity. There are a lot of words that mean \"little\" or \"small,\" but paucity is used when you mean specifically \"not enough\" or \"too little.\" People in LA don't understand how New Yorkers can live with such a paucity of space. For what New Yorkers pay for a tiny apartment, Angelenos get a house and a yard.", "MEANING: noun.- a person who is very poor SENTENCE: Pauper is an old-fashioned word for someone who is poor \u2014 really poor, like the paupers described by Charles Dickens or Mark Twain.

If your neighbors bring you an expensive watch from Switzerland because you fed their cat while they were traveling, thank them for their largesse. MNEMONIC: Though pronounced \"lar JESS,\" the word largesse looks sort of like largeness. That's an easy way to remember what largesse means: think of it as largeness of spirit. Largesse can describe the generosity of someone giving gifts, or it can describe the gift itself. You could dispense largess by buying your brother a flashy car from your lottery winnings.", "MEANING: adjective.- not straightforwardadjective.- highly complex or intricate and occasionally deviousadjective.- marked by repeated turns and bends SENTENCE: Tortuous means twisting or complicated. \"James Bond drove up a mountain road that was tortuous in its twists and turns.

Visiting a veal farm and witnessing the torturous conditions the calves are kept in might convince you to become a vegetarian. MNEMONIC: The adjective torturous is good for describing physically painful situations, especially if the pain is truly agonizing.

Which is how you'd describe two lovebirds gushing over each other or your grandma\u2019s cooing, cheek pinches, and sloppy-lipstick kisses.

Oddly enough, it's rooted in the Middle English word maggot and originally meant \u201csickly or nauseated.\u201d But mawkish eventually evolved to mean something so overly sentimental it makes you sick.
